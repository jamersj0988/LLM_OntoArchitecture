Assignment to Group
===================

The _Assignment to Group_ establishes the assignment of an object to a group, being an arbitrary collection of objects. It is the complementary concept template to _Group Assignment_ defining how objects are assigned by a group.

The grouping relationship does not apply any other meaning than grouping objects under some aspect. It is non-hierarchical, meaning that objects can be assigned to many groups, and it does not interfere with other relationship concepts, such as _Element Decomposition_. The grouping relationship allows for sub groups being grouped in groups.

Group Assignment
================

The _Group Assignment_ establishes an arbitrary collection of objects within a group. The grouping relationship does not apply any other meaning then grouping objects under some aspect. It is non-hierarchical, that is objects can be grouped into different logical groups, and it does not interfere with other relationship concepts, such as _ObjectAggregation_.

The _Group Assignment_ establish a group being the collection for other objects. It allows for a group being a collection including sub groups. An _IfcZone_ is a specific group object for collecting spaces, _IfcDistributionSystem_ is a specific group object for collecting distribution elements. Usually a grouping relationship is applied to group elements for a particular purpose or function. It usually implies the existence of a grouping relationship and the provision of some identity under which the group is characterized.

* Group collection is handled by an instance of _IfcRelAssignsToGroup_, which assigns all group members to the _IfcGroup_ being the collection.
* Objects included in a group as collected items are linked by _IsGroupedBy_ pointing to _IfcRelAssignsToGroup_.
* Collected items may include sub groups. Therefore the _Group Assignment_ may establish a tree

> NOTE  The _IfcGroup_ may not yet have a grouping relationship established, it then identifies an empty group.

> EXAMPLE  An air handler belonging to an air conditioning system is an example of such group assignment.

> EXAMPLE A wall type may define multiple layers of material. A wall of that wall type will then have a geometry with a thickness that corresponds with the layers in the wall type.

The usage may parametrically define an 'Axis' reference curve, and a direction, offset, and extent of the layers to extend along the axis. This allows layers to slope or only extend up to a particular height.

Material Set
============

Composite or multiple materials may be described using a material set. There are three types of material sets to choose from:

 * Layer sets - layered materials with a thickness that fills a boundary
 * Profile sets - when materials are extruded along a profiled shape
 * Constituent sets - when materials are either homogeneously mixed, or arbitrarily placed

> EXAMPLE A wall or slab may use a layer set. A beam, column, pipe, or duct may use a profile set, even if it only has one profile. Composite beams may be made out of multiple profiles. Concrete may use a constituent set for portions of sand and cement. A window frame may also use a constituent set for one material for its frame and another material for its glazing portion.

The material is defined by either _IfcMaterialLayerSet_, _IfcMaterialProfileSet_, or _IfcMaterialConstituentSet_ and related using _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_.RelatingMaterial. Independent of the material used, each layer, profile, or constituent within the set may be identified using a name and category.

Material Association
====================

Any product or product type can have associated materials indicating the physical composition of an object.

> EXAMPLE  An object can be comprised of a single material or a set of materials with a particular layout. Several examples include: > * a slab may have an associated layer of concrete;
> * a beam may have an associated I-Shape profile of steel;
> * a door may have associated constituents for framing and glazing;
> * a port may have an associated profile and/or material flowing through it such as hot water.

Materials can have representations for surface styles indicating colors, textures, and light reflectance for 3D rendering. Materials can have representations for fill styles indicating colors, tiles, and hatch patterns for 2D rendering. Materials can have properties such as density, elasticity, thermal resistance, and others as defined in this specification. Materials can also be classified according to a referenced industry standard.

> EXAMPLE  Material information can also be given at object type, defining the common material data for all occurrences of the same type. Object type is then accessible by the inverse _IsTypedBy_ relationship, further pointing via its _HasAssociations_ inverse relation and via _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial.RelatingMaterial_ to the material information. If both are given, then the material directly assigned to object occurrence overrides the material assigned to object type.

Object Predefined Type
======================

Many object occurrences have an attribute named _PredefinedType_ being a specific enumeration. Such predefined type essentially provides another level of "classification by inheritance" to further differentiate objects without the need for additional sub types. Predefined types are not just informational; various rules apply such as applicable property sets, part composition, and distribution ports. Such predefined types are added by selecting the correct enumerator for the attribute _PredefinedType_. If a custom value is needed, the attribute _ObjectType_ has to be used to define such custom type, whereas the _PredefinedType_ is set to _USERDEFINED_.

The main attributes to be provided for an _Object Occurrence Predefined Type_ are:

* _PredefinedType_: holds the entity specific enumeration of predefined types to further classify the entity
* _ObjectType_: allows for a custom value, if no applicable enumerator can be found

If the object is typed by an _IfcTypeObject_, then the _PredefinedType_ at the _IfcObject_ occurrence shall only be used if the _PredefinedType_ at _IfcTypeObject_ is set to _NOTDEFINED_.

Note that the PredefinedType attribute itself is defined at the leaf classes of the inheritance hierarchy with a specific enumeration attribute for that given leaf class.

```

Object Type Predefined Type
===========================

Many object occurrence and object type entities have an attribute named _PredefinedType_ consisting of a specific enumeration. Such predefined type essentially provides another level of inheritance to further differentiate objects without the need for additional entities. Predefined types are not just informational; various rules apply such as applicable property sets, part composition, and distribution ports. If the object is typed by an _IfcTypeObject_, then the _PredefinedType_ at the _IfcObject_ occurrence shall only be used if the _PredefinedType_ at _IfcTypeObject_ is set to _NOTDEFINED_.

Note that the PredefinedType attribute itself is defined at the leaf classes of the inheritance hierarchy with a specific enumeration attribute for that given leaf class.

Spatial Element Type Predefined Type
====================================

> NOTE: This template for attributes, like similar ones, originates from legacy requirements tied to mvdXML and an earlier era when MVD defined exchange information requirements. Such templates no longer add value to the specification, nor do they convey information beyond what is already defined in the schema. Additionally, some templates reference deprecated entities, potentially causing unnecessary confusion.
As part of a broader effort to clean up documentation, this and other non-essential templates will be removed in the next release.

If a custom value is needed to describe a spatial element type, the attribute _ElementType_ may be used to define such custom type, where the _PredefinedType_ is set to _USERDEFINED_.

Specific subtypes introduce additional attributes for the _Object User Identity_ template.

* Spatial element type sub types may be further identified via the _Tag_ attribute. While there is no restriction on usage of such tags, it is recommended the _Tag_ is unique within its containing scope.
* Spatial element type sub types may be further attributed via the _LongName_ attribute. While the _Name_ attribute generally provides a coded or abbreviated identifier, the _LongName_ provides a functional name for the location such as "Reception Area".

> NOTE  Since the corresponding occurrences of _IfcSpatialElementType_ do not have a _Tag_ attribute, it is recommended not to use it here.

While there is no restriction on usage of such identifier, it is recommended the _Name_ is unique within it's containing scope. Further guidance on usage is provided at specific entities; for example, for spaces, the _Name_ may reflect a room number. An object may have a description provided via the _Description_ attribute that provides further context in identifying or locating the object.

Specific subtypes introduce additional attributes for the _Object User Identity_ template.

* Spatial objects may be further identified via the _LongName_ attribute. This value should generally correspond to building signage describing floor levels or rooms.

Object Attributes
=================

All entities having semantic significance derive from _IfcRoot_, where instances are identifiable within a data set using a compressed globally unique identifier (IFC-GUID). This identifier must never change during the lifetime of an object, which allows data to be merged, versioned, or referenced from other locations.

Resource-level instances (not deriving from _IfcRoot_) do not have any identity, such that two instances having identical state are considered equal. For example, if an object has coordinates described by an _IfcCartesianPoint_ instance, another object with the same coordinates may have a separate instance of _IfcCartesianPoint_ or share the same instance; such difference is a matter of data storage optimization and does not imply any semantic relationship. This also implies that non-rooted instances may only exist if referenced by at least one rooted instance through either a direct attribute or inverse attribute, or following a chain of attribute references on instances.

The distinction between rooted and non-rooted (resource-level) entities achieves several goals:
* File size may be reduced by interning (sharing) non-rooted data instances;
* Database retrieval may be more efficient by storing non-rooted data local to rooted data instances;
* Storage size may be reduced by avoiding IFC-GUID storage for items not requiring direct retrieval;
* Comparisons of differences may be done at a higher level where the context of such change is apparent;
* Implementations may treat non-rooted data instances as immutable for efficiency or simplified usage.

PATH: templates/Object Attributes/Revision Control/README.md
CATEGORY: templates
----------------------------------

Revision Control
================

While objects may reflect a final state, they may also be continually revised over the course of a project lifecycle and reflect transient state. For scenarios of multiple users making updates to the same information, there is a concept of local copies of information based upon a shared repository supporting multiple users. Such shared repository is often referred to as a _model server_. A model server is similar in concept to a document revision server, but is able to identify changes declared on a per-object basis rather than inferring changes from differences in text. A model server has a concept of revisions on a per-project basis, where each revision consists of a set of changes to contained objects by a particular user at a particular time.

To support a model server scenario, each object may be marked with a _change action_ indicating the object was added, modified, deleted, or has no change since the project was retrieved from the server at a particular revision sequence. Given an object's identity (IFC-GUID) and change action, the state of the object may be merged when submitted to a model server. An object is considered modified when any of its direct attributes change, attributes on a referenced resource definition (any entity not deriving from _IfcRoot_) change, items are added or removed from sets, or items are added, removed, or reordered within lists.

For cases when multiple users make conflicting changes to the same objects, users may choose to keep their own changes, accept changes from others, merge both changes, or a combination thereof upon submitting to a server. Alternatively, to avoid such merge scenario and coordinate work, objects may be locked such that a particular user has exclusive access to read and/or write a particular object at the current time.

Project libraries may also be retrieved from model servers having particular revision, and potentially different server URI than the referencing Project. As a project may include multiple revisions of the same project library (a common scenario when multiple users are involved using libraries revised by others), the IfcRoot.ObjectIdentifier IFC-GUID is only valid within the scope of the referencing project, and a separate _library reference_ identifies a project library based object within its originating model server.

Finally, objects may also carry informational attributes indicating when an object was created, who, when, and what application was used to last modify an object, and who currently owns the object, potentially having exclusive use according to its lock state.

Software Identity
=================

An object needs to be identifiable for accurate processing by both human and automated processes. Identification may be through several attributes such as Identification, Name, Description or GUID. The GUID is compressed for the purpose of being exchanged within an IFC data set - the compressed GUID is referred to as "IFC-GUID". While the IFC-GUID is normally generated automatically and has to be persistent, the Identification may relate to other informal registers but should be unique within the set of objects of the same type. The Name and Description should allow any object to be identified in the context of the project or facility being modelled.

Various objects may have additional identifications that may be human-readable and/or may be structured through classification association. Various file formats may use additional identifications of instances for serialization purposes, however there is no requirement or guarantee for such identifications to remain the same between revisions or across applications.

> EXAMPLE The ISO 10303-11 Clear text encoding (referred to as STEP physical file SPF format) lists each instance with a positive integer that is unique within a particular file. In the code example that follows that is the number 123. Contrary to the _GlobalId_ attribute, this is *not* intended as a stable identifier across repeated exchanges or reserializations. `#123=IFCPERSON($,$,'Alice',$,$,$,$,$);`

Element Composition
===================

Provision of an aggregation structure where the element is part of another element representing the composite. The part then provides, if such concepts are in scope of the Model View Definition, exclusively the following:

* _Body Geometry_ &mdash; The partial body shape representation and its placement;
* _Material_ &mdash; The material information for the part.

The part may also provide, in addition to the aggregate, more specifically the following:

* _Property Sets_ &mdash; The parts may have individual property sets assigned, solely or in addition to the composite;
* _Quantity Sets_ &mdash; The parts may have individual quantity sets assigned, solely or in addition to the composite.

The part should not be contained in the spatial hierarchy, i.e. the concept _Spatial Containment_ shall not be used at the level of parts. The part is contained in the spatial structure by the spatial containment of its composite.

> EXAMPLE  An _IfcBeam_ may be aggregated into an element assembly using the objectified relationship _IfcRelAggregates_, referring to it by its inverse attribute _SELF\IfcObjectDefinition.Decomposes_. Any subtype of _IfcElement_ can be an element assembly, with _IfcElementAssembly_ as a special focus subtype. In this case it should not be additionally contained in the spatial hierarchy, i.e. _SELF\IfcElement.ContainedInStructure_ should be NIL.

Aggregation
===========

An aggregation indicates an internal unordered part composition relationship between the whole structure, referred to as the "composite", and the subordinate components, referred to as the "parts". The concept of aggregation is used in various ways. Examples are:

* Aggregation is used on building elements to indicate parts such as studs within a wall;
* Aggregation is used on spatial elements to indicate a spatial structure such as a storey within a building;
* Aggregation is used on systems to indicate subsystems such as branch circuits.

Aggregation is a bi-directional relationship, the relationship from the composite to its parts is called Decomposition, and the relationship from the part to its composite is called Composition.

Spatial Composition
===================

Provision of a spatial structure of the project by aggregating spatial elements. The spatial structure is a hierarchical tree of spatial elements ultimately assigned to the project. Composition refers to the relationship to a higher level element (e.g. this storey is part of a building or this road segment is part of a road).

> NOTE  The link between the highest level spatial element(s) and the project is provided by this concept through _IfcRelAggregates_ and not through declaration using _IfcRelDeclares_. This is a known anomaly introduced to maintain compatibility with earlier versions of this standard.

The project spatial structure may be made up of a selection of different spatial structure elements with the most generic and simplest form from high to low level as follows: _IfcProject_, _IfcSite_, _IfcFacility_ (or any of its subtypes), _IfcFacilityPart_ (or _IfcBuildingStorey_ in the case of buildings), and _IfcSpace_ with _IfcSite_, _IfcFacilityPart_ and _IfcSpace_ being optional levels. Therefore a spatial structure element should only be part of an element at the same or higher level, with the exception of _IfcFacility_ which can be part of an _IfcFacilityPart_ to allow for the regional or longitudinal division of a higher level facility into sections which can then contain one or more smaller functional facilities.

Where possible, the relevant subtype of _IfcFacility_ should be used to describe the spatial structure element in question. When an adequate subtype of _IfcFacility_ with predefined or user defined type is not available the higher level, generic _IfcFacility_ entity can be instantiated with the relevant and agreed typing identifier defined in _IfcFacility.ObjectType_. This allows for nearly full coverage of built environment domains and/or scenarios that have yet to be addressed with specific extensions.

In addition to the identified spatial structure elements _IfcSpatialZone_ can be used to provide cross domain or functional zones within a project. These elements are included into the hierarchy using the _Spatial Containment_ concept (_IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure_) and can be aggregated into a functional hierarchy in the same manner as other spatial structure elements, with the constraint that an _IfcSpatialZone_ can only be composed within another _IfcSpatialZone_.

Alignment Layout - Reusing Horizontal Layout
============================================

Nesting and aggregation relationships between _IfcAlignment_'s and their layouts, in the case where multiple alignments re-use the same horizontal layout definition.

In the diagram below is an example of a *parent* alignment, with the horizontal layout, and two *child* alignments, one with a vertical layout, and the other with a vertical and a cant layout; both re-using the definition of the horizontal layout from the *parent* alignment.

When defining the list of segments for the business logic (i.e., _IfcAlignmentHorizontalSegment_, _IfcAlignmentVerticalSegment_, _IfcAlignmentCantSegment_):

1. A **zero-length segment** shall be added, at the end of the list of segments for _IfcAlignmentSegment.DesignParameters_.
2. If the geometry definition is also present, then each of the zero-length segments shall have a _IfcCurveSegment_ counterpart - of length zero.

Alignment Layouts
============================================

A single alignment may be described by one or more of the following layouts:

* a horizontal layout (_IfcAlignmentHorizontal_), defined in the x/y plane of the engineering coordinate system.
* an accompanying vertical layout (_IfcAlignmentVertical_), defined along the horizontal layout in the distance along / z coordinate space.
* an accompanying cant layout (_IfcAlignmentCant_), defined as lateral inclination along the horizontal layout.

These 3 layouts may be used in different configurations. See **Alignment Layout - Horizontal, Vertical and Cant** and **Alignment Layout - Reusing Horizontal Layout** for details.

----------------------------------

Element Nesting
===============

Provision of a nesting structure where the element, representing the host, has connectable components represented by other elements.

The nesting structure then provides the following:

* _Placement_ &mdash; the common object coordinate system to which the components are placed relative
* _Body Geometry_ &mdash; geometry of the nesting element is independent from the _Body Geometry_ of nested parts;

The hosted component should not be contained in the spatial hierarchy, i.e. the concept _Spatial Containment_ shall not be used at the level of hosted components. The hosted component is contained in the spatial structure by the spatial containment of its host.

Examples of element nesting include:

* Doors having holes pre-drilled to attach knobs
* Sinks having holes pre-drilled to attach faucets
* Junction boxes having one or more gangs where switches, outlets, or fixtures may be attached

Element nesting should be used for cases where the hosting element has a specific position for attaching other elements of a particular type or form factor where there is no port connection. Ports should be used for scenarios where there is any distribution flow between objects (e.g. electricity, liquid, air/gas). For all other physical connections, the _IfcRelConnectsElements_ relationship and its subtypes should be used.

> EXAMPLE  Electric distribution boards would use ports to connect to contained circuit breakers rather than nesting, because there is an electrical connection between the board and each breaker.

A general rule for using nesting as opposed to aggregation is based on the contents of the manufactured product as ordered according to its specified article number. If the product includes the component (regardless of whether it comes assembled), then it should use aggregation. If the product does not include any such component but is specifically designed for attaching to other components, then it should use nesting.

Nesting
=======

A nesting indicates an external ordered part composition relationship between the hosting structure, referred to as the "host", and the attached components, referred to as the "hosted elements". The concept of nesting is used in various ways. Examples are:

* Nesting is used on product elements to indicate external connectable parts such as faucets mounted on a sink, or switches within a junction box.
* Nesting is used on control objects to indicate specification hierarchies.
* Nesting is used on process objects to indicate subordinate processes which may occur in parallel or in series.
* Nesting is used on resource objects to indicate subordinate resource allocations which may occur in parallel or in series.

Nesting is a bi-directional relationship, the relationship from the hosting structure to its attached components is called Nesting, and the relationship from the components to their containing structure is called Hosting.

Type Element Nesting
====================

Hosted components may be specified on types, following the same rules as defined for corresponding occurrences.

On type objects, hosted components do not have types defined, but serve as placeholders indicating that occurrences of the enclosing type object shall use a duplicate list of hosted components, where the types are defined at each occurrence.

This relationship differs from _IfcRelAggregates_, which is used to define explicit decomposition of elements at specified placement; this nesting relationship indicates an arbitrary composition of elements, where placement is defined parametrically -- either implicitly (material profile, layer, or constituent association) or explicitly (constraint association).

The order and naming of components may be significant based on parameterized material association. For example, if the _IfcElementType_ has an associated _IfcMaterialLayerSet_, then layers are constructed according to material associations of each nested _IfcElement_, and the _Name_ of each _IfcMaterialLayer_ must correspond to the _Name_ of each _IfcElement_.

Group Spatial Connectivity
==========================

The concept of Group Spatial Connectivity allows for the association of a _IfcGroup_ (and its relevant subtypes) representing a grouping of objects to a particular spatial structure, either an entire facility (and its specific subtypes e.g. buildings, bridges, roads, or marine facilities), a facility part, a building storey, or any part of these structures.

The group (_IfcGroup_) in question should be human identifiable by its _Name_ attribute.

The relationship (_IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure_) in question can provide context of the connection through the _Name_ and _Description_ attributes.

The use of _IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure_ in this template provides the relationship across spatial and functional hierarchies allowing the spatial coverage of functional groups.

It is permissible for an _IfcGroup_ not to be related to any spatial structure element. When the _IfcGroup_ is **not** connected to the spatial structure it must be declared to the _IfcProject_ using the _Project declaration template_ via the IfcRelDeclares relationship, or have a parent _IfcGroup_ (or its relevant subtypes) through the use of composition, with said parent _IfcGroup_ either connected to the spatial structure using _Group Spatial Connectivity_ or declared to the _IfcProject_ using the _Project declaration template_.

> NOTE IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure is also used in the template _Spatial Service Connectivity_ to relate IfcSystem (subtype of IfcGroup) and can also be used for referencing IfcProduct as part of its _RelatedElements_.

Spatial Service Connectivity
============================

A system, such as a distribution system, services a particular spatial structure, either an entire facility (and its specific subtypes e.g. buildings, bridges, roads, or marine facilities), a facility part, a building storey, or any part of these structures.
The system (_IfcSystem_) in question should be human identifiable by its _Name_ attribute.
The use of _IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure_ in this template provides the relationship across spatial and functional hierarchies allowing the spatial coverage of functional systems.

Spatial Structure
=================

Spatial structures, such as site, building, storey, or spaces, may contain physical elements, including building elements, distribution elements, and furnishing elements. The containment relationship between the physical elements and the spatial structures is hierarchical, i.e. a physical element shall only be contained within a single spatial structure.

> EXAMPLE  An _IfcBeam_ is placed within the spatial hierarchy using the objectified relationship _IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure_, referring to it by its inverse attribute _SELF\IfcElement.ContainedInStructure_. Subtypes of _IfcSpatialStructureElement_ are valid spatial containers, with _IfcBuildingStorey_ being the default container.

The spatial containment relationship, together with the Spatial decomposition relationship, being hierarchical as well, establishes the hierarchical project tree structure in a building information model.

> EXAMPLE  The _IfcBuildingStorey_ that logically contains the _IfcBeam_ decomposes the _IfcBuilding_ using the _IfcRelAggregates_ relationship. Therefore the _IfcBeam_ is also indirectly contained in the building.

Spatial Container
=================

The _Spatial Container_ concept defines a spatial element as being the spatial container for physical elements, or other elements being directly related to the spatial container, such as annotations or grids.

> EXAMPLE  A building story is a logical spatial container of building elements, distribution elements, or furnishing elements.

The _Spatial Container_ concept is realized by using the _IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure_ objectified relationship between subtypes of _IfcSpatialElement_ and the elements contained. The inverse relationship _ContainsElements_ at the subtypes of _IfcSpatialElement_ refers to the contained physical elements.

```

Spatial Containment
===================

The _Spatial Containment_ concept defines the relationship of physical elements, such as building elements, distribution elements, or furnishing elements as being contained within a spatial structure element.

Any subtype of _IfcElement_ may participate in two different containment relationships. The first (and in most implementation scenarios mandatory) relationship is the hierarchical spatial containment, the second (optional) relationship is the aggregation within an element assembly.

* The subtypes of _IfcElement_ are placed within the project spatial hierarchy using the objectified relationship _IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure_, referring to it by its inverse attribute _SELF\IfcElement.ContainedInStructure_. Subtypes of _IfcSpatialElement_ are valid spatial containers.
* The subtypes of _IfcElement_ may be aggregated into an element assembly using the objectified relationship _IfcRelAggregates_, referring to it by its inverse attribute _SELF\IfcObjectDefinition.Decomposes_. Any subtype of _IfcElement_ can be an element assembly, with _IfcElementAssembly_ as a special focus subtype. In this case it should not be additionally contained in the project spatial hierarchy, i.e. _SELF\IfcElement.ContainedInStructure_ should be _NIL_.

Spatial Interference
====================

The _Spatial Interference_ concept defines the relationship of spatial elements, such as facilities (_IfcFacility_ & specialised subtypes) or facility parts (_IfcFacilityPart_ with domain specific predefined types) that interfere or interface with other spatial elements across discipline spatial hierarchy branches. The _IfcSpatialElement_ entities should be identifiable by their _IfcSpatialElement.Name_ attribute and an optional _IfcRelInterferesElements.InterferenceType_ should be included to describe the nature of the interface or interference.

A simple example is a project that contains a road or railway development that includes a bridge section. _IfcRelInterferesElements_ is used to semantically link the spatial segments of the road or railway that pass over the bridge or bridge segments with the relevant interference type specified. This semantic relationship provides an easily queryable connection to identify the spatial elements that require consideration across disciplines such as the road design team and bridge design team. How the spatial hierarchy is organised is up to the user and project in question.

----------------------------------

Spatial Interference With Zones
===============================

The _Spatial Interference with Zone_ concept is an extension of the _Spatial Interference_ concept which defines the relationship of spatial elements, such as facilities (_IfcFacility_ & specialised subtypes) or facility parts (_IfcFacilityPart_ with domain specific predefined types) that interfere or interface with other spatial elements across discipline spatial hierarchy branches, and extends the dataset with a related interference _IfcSpatialZone_ via the _IfcRelInterferesElements.InterferenceSpace_ attribute. The realizing _IfcSpatialZone_ should always have the _PredefinedType_ value set to _INTERFERENCE_.

The addition of a realizing _IfcSpatialZone_ extends the functionality of this relationship with the following:

- The ability to attach property sets to the co-engineering (or interference) zone.
- Allows explicit definition of the shared footprint or body geometry representing the zone where the _IfcSpatialElement_ entities interfere, without impacting the footprint or body geometry of the interfering _IfcSpatialElement_ entities.
- Products are still positioned within the domain spatial structure and can use relative positioning.

The _Spatial Interference with Zone_ concept is defined to cover complex use cases where the interference results in co-engineering zones where multiple teams have to collaborate within the same spatial area while maintaining ownership and rights over their domain elements. A common example of this is a level crossing between a railway and a road. The road and railway hierarchies each have a segment that relates to the level crossing and an _IfcRelInterferesElements_ relationship is defined to encode this connection. The relationship is then extended with an _IfcSpatialZone_ that defines the co-engineering zone and specific overlapping footprint or body geometry. Property sets can then be attached to the _IfcSpatialZone_ and the explicit footprint or body geometry can be utilised for automated clash and cross domain approval/notification of model updates.

Object Typing
=============

Object occurrences can be defined by a particular object type, using the _Object Typing_ concept. A pair of entities are defined for most semantic objects - an object occurrence entity and a corresponding object type entity.

> EXAMPLE  The _IfcTank_ is the object occurrence entity that has a corresponding _IfcTankType_ being the object type entity.

On instance level, an object occurrence instance may have:

* similar state as its object type instance by applying all characteristics defined at the type;
* overridden state for particular characteristics;
* no defined object type instance.

Characteristics defined at the object type level may include:

* common naming and predefined type;
* common properties within a type driven property set;
* common geometry representations, applied as mapped representation to each occurrence;
* common material assignments (with exception of material set usages);
* common definition of a decomposition structure.

Many object occurrence and object type entities have an attribute named _PredefinedType_ consisting of a specific enumeration. Such predefined type essentially provides another level of inheritance to further differentiate objects without the need for additional entities. Predefined types are not just informational; various rules apply such as applicable property sets, part composition, and distribution ports. If the object is typed by an _IfcTypeObject_, then the _PredefinedType_ at the _IfcObject_ occurrence shall only be used if the _PredefinedType_ at _IfcTypeObject_ is set to _NOTDEFINED_.

> EXAMPLE  For scenarios of object types having part compositions, such parts may be reflected at object occurrences having separate state. For example, a _wall type_ may define a particular arrangement of studs, a _wall occurrence_ may reflect the same arrangement of studs, and studs within the wall occurrence may participate in specific relationships that do not exist at the type such as being connected to an electrical junction box.

> NOTE  If the object type has aggregated elements, such objects are reflected at the object occurrence using the _IfcRelDefinesByObject_ relationship.

Cosine Spiral Transition Segment
================================

The cosine spiral transition segment is a special case of a spiral where the curvature rate of change is a cosine function and the terms are dependent on the length L measured from the inflection point. The parameter value is defined as the deflection i.e. bearing angle &Theta.

The values of its individual terms dependent on segment length L:
CosineTerm = L
ConstantTerm = 1

Terms for the second half of the segment:
QuadraticTerm =  -L/√2
LinearTerm = L/4
Constant = -1

_SegmentStart_ is the bearing angle at start and _SegmentLength_ is the bearing angle at the end of the segment.

Image Texture
=============

Image textures are based on external files in common image formats such as PNG or JPEG. Such files may be located on servers according to absolute URLs, on the same server as the IFC file according to relative URLs, within the same local directory according to relative file path, within an IFC-ZIP file according to relative file path, or within an arbitrary directory according to absolute file path.

Absolute URLs are recommended for textures published at a location deemed to be permanent (independent of the building model data), while relative URLs are recommended for all other sharing scenarios. Local file paths should be avoided.

* _IfcGradientCurve_ as a 3D horizontal and vertical alignment (represented by their alignment segments), without a cant layout.
* _IfcSegmentedReferenceCurve_ as a 3D curve defined relative to an _IfcGradientCurve_ to incorporate the application of cant.
* _IfcOffsetCurveByDistances_ as a 2D or 3D curve defined relative to an _IfcGradientCurve_ or another _IfcOffsetCurveByDistances_.
* _IfcPolyline_ or _IfcIndexedPolyCurve_ as a 3D alignment by a 3D polyline representation (such as coming from a survey).
* _IfcPolyline_ or _IfcIndexedPolyCurve_ as a 2D horizontal alignment by a 2D polyline representation (such as in very early planning phases or as a map representation).

Annotations may provide an 'Annotation' representation for including points, curves, surfaces, fill areas, and text.

Styled items may provide structure and styles that apply to the representation, a geometric set may provide styles that apply to all items within, and/or items may provide their own styles which override styles defined at the geometric set. Styles and label can also be assigned by presentation layers.

The representation identifier of the annotation representation is:

Axis Geometry
=============

Elements following a path provide an 'Axis' representation indicating a line segment or any arbitrary open bounded curve. Examples of such elements include walls, beams, columns, pipes, ducts, and cables. For elements that have a material profile set association indicating cross-section, a 'Body' representation may be generated based on the axis curve and material profiles. Curve styles may indicate particular colors, line thicknesses, and dash patterns for 2D rendering.

The representation identifier of the axis representation is:

* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._RepresentationIdentifier_ = 'Axis'

> EXAMPLE  A two-dimensional bounded curve is used as the wall axis in standard walls, a three-dimensional bounded curve is used as the reference axis in standard columns.

Product Linear Placement
========================

A Product Linear Placement takes into account the ISO 19148 Linear referencing standard. Linear placement is defined by a position relative to a _IfcLinearPositioningElement_ (distance along and optionally lateral, vertical and longitudinal offsets), a horizontal reference direction, and a vertical axis direction. Each product placed with Product Linear Placement has an absolute placement on the _IfcLinearPositioningElement_._Representation_ where the _IfcLinearPositioningElement_  is typically instantiated as an IfcAlignment. Therefore, similarly to how _IfcSpatialElement_._ObjectPlacement_ sets the context for all contained elements, the _IfcLinearPositioningElement_._ObjectPlacement_ sets the context for all elements positioned on it. Consequently, each product placement that uses Product Linear Placement references the _IfcObjectPlacement_ of the _IfcLinearPositioningElement_ through _IfcLinearPlacement_._PlacementRelTo_.

----------------------------------

Product Local Placement
=======================

Product occurrences can be placed in 3D space relative to where they are contained. Placement is defined by a relative position (X, Y, Z coordinates), a horizontal reference direction, and a vertical axis direction. At the outermost level, relative directions are defined according to representation context; for example, +X may point east, +Y may point north, and +Z may point up.

Placement follows aggregation and containment relationships as follows:

* at the outermost level, a site is globally positioned according to latitude, longitude, and elevation;
* for spatial structures, positioning is relative to aggregation. For example, a site may aggregate multiple buildings, each building may aggregate multiple building storeys, and each building storey may aggregate multiple spaces;
* for building elements, positioning is relative to the containing spatial structure. For example, a building storey may contain slabs, walls, columns, and beams;
* for aggregated parts, positioning is relative to aggregation. For example, a staircase may aggregate one or more stair flights;
* for feature elements, positioning is relative to the affected building element. For example, an opening element is positioned relative to the wall it voids, which in turn is positioned relative to a building storey;
* for fillings, positioning is relative to the filled opening. For example, a door is positioned relative to an opening which in turn is positioned relative to a wall;
* for distribution ports, positioning is relative to the containing distribution element. For example, an air terminal may have a port connection for a duct segment or fitting;
* for distribution elements, positioning is relative to the containing spatial structure, however may be constrained by port connections. For example, a electrical junction box may fill an opening within a wall, and the junction box may contain ports for contained outlets or switches; the placement of such connected elements is constrained relative to connected port of the junction box. As another example, an air terminal may fill a ceiling covering which is placed relative to a space; the placement of a connecting duct fitting may be constrained relative to the air terminal.

If a containing spatial structure contains a grid, then placement may also be based relative to grid coordinates. In certain use cases, an absolute placement may be used by omitting the _IfcObjectPlacement_. In this case, the shape representation is defined within the world coordinate system.

Product Type Geometric Representation
=====================================

Product types may have representations indicating shape representation for geometry, clearance, or other concepts.

The shape representation attached to a type is defined using the relationship _RepresentationMaps_ of data type _IfcRepresentationMap_. It provides the means to store several representation maps for different purposes. In order to utilize the representation map at each occurrence of the product type, the product occurrence has to use the concept 'Mapped Geometry'.

> NOTE  See _IfcTypeProduct_ for further information and figures/ explaining the concepts 'Product Type Representation' and 'Mapped Geometry'.

CATEGORY: templates
----------------------------------

Type Axis Geometry
==================

The Axis representation may be defined on product types that have a concept of a linear representation, which may also correspond to structural axis or distribution flow path.

For distribution elements, this represents the 3D flow path of the item having _IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationType_ of 'Curve3D' and containing a single _IfcBoundedCurve_ subtype such as _IfcPolyline_, _IfcTrimmedCurve_, or _IfcCompositeCurve_. For elements containing directional ports (_IfcDistributionPort_ with _FlowDirection_ of _SOURCE_ or _SINK_), the direction of the curve indicates direction of flow where a _SINK_ port is positioned at the start of the curve and a _SOURCE_ port is positioned at the end of the curve. This representation is most applicable to flow segment types (pipes, ducts, cables), however may be used at other elements to define a primary flow path if applicable.

If an element type is defined parametrically (such as a flow segment type defining common material profile but no particular length or path), then no representations shall be asserted at the type.

> NOTE  The product representations are defined as representation maps at the level of the supertype _IfcTypeProduct_, which get assigned by an element occurrence instance through the _IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]_ being an _IfcMappedItem_.

Project Units
=============

The project context includes the definition of the default units within the IFC data set. They are declared once for the context of the whole data set. Default units are those units that apply:

* to all geometric representation items within the geometric representation contexts;
* to all attributes with a defined datatype indicating a measure datatype;
* to all properties and quantities with a defined datatype indicating a measure datatype and with no local unit definitions provided.

Default units are defined as either:

* SI Units with SI unit name and prefix
* Conversion based units with a conversion factor to its SI unit
* Derived units, consisting of one-to-many unit elements, being SI units or conversion based units
* Monetary unit as a special case of a unit to hold the currency name

> EXAMPLE  Meter is an SI unit without prefix, milli meter is an SI unit with prefix, inch and foot are conversion based units to be declared with a conversion factor to the SI unit (here meter), heat flux density (W/m2) is a derived unit with the unit elements Power (W) and Area (m2), and Euro is a monetary unit.

This chapter defines such common concepts, which are applied at entities having specific use. Such concepts also form the basis of model views, which are supplementary specifications that adapt the scope of this schema for targeted use of the IFC standard for specific levels of advancement in usage.

Each concept template defines a graph of entities and attributes and parameters for particular attributes and instance types. Various entities within this schema reference such concept templates and adapt them for particular use according to parameters.
