# IfcPerformanceHistory

_IfcPerformanceHistory_ is used to document the actual performance of an occurrence instance over time. It includes machine-measured data from building automation systems and human-specified data such as task and resource usage. The data may represent actual conditions, predictions, or simulations.
<!-- end of short definition -->

The realtime data tracked by performance history takes the form of property sets where all properties are based on time series. Unlike design-based data at occurrences and types, performance-driven data is time-sensitive and may change in realtime by some measurement device. Data may be captured at irregular intervals such as when values change beyond established thresholds, or at regular intervals of specified duration.

### Declaration use definition
_IfcPerformanceHistory_ may be declared within a project using _IfcRelDeclares_ where _RelatingContext_ refers to the _IfcProject_ and _RelatedDefinitions_ includes the _IfcPerformanceHistory_. Default units (used for property sets) are indicated by the declaring project. Only top-level objects are declared; nested performance history objects (through _IfcRelNests_) do not participate in such relationship.

## Attributes

### LifeCyclePhase
Describes the applicable building life-cycle phase. Typical values should be DESIGNDEVELOPMENT, SCHEMATICDEVELOPMENT, CONSTRUCTIONDOCUMENT, CONSTRUCTION, ASBUILT, COMMISSIONING, OPERATION, etc.

### PredefinedType
Predefined generic type for a performance history that is specified in an enumeration.
{ .change-ifc2x4}

## Concepts

### Aggregation

IfcPerformanceHistory may be decomposed into components using IfcRelNests where RelatingObject refers to the enclosing IfcPerformanceHistory and RelatedObjects contains one or more IfcPerformanceHistory components. Composition indicates breakdown of further detail and may correspond to the hierarchy of objects it represents.

### Library Association

IfcPerformanceHistory may refer to external systems, such as a time series data source within a building automation system or a cost code in an accounting system for resource allocation.

### Control Assignment



#### IfcGroup

A system or zone for which time-based system information is provided, such as overall status parameters of a building control system.

#### IfcProduct

A building space, physical device, or port for which time-based information is provided, such as a chiller or an analog input within a device.

#### IfcProcess

A process for which time-based information is provided, such as an alarm event being raised and acknowledged, or regular and overtime costs incurred for a task.

#### IfcResource

A resource for which usage is recorded or planned over time, such as wage rates and number of workers at particular times.

### Property Sets for Performance

The property sets relating to this entity are defined by IfcPropertySet and attached by the IfcRelDefinesByProperties relationship. They are accessible by the IsDefinedBy inverse attribute. Applicable property sets are defined at assigned entities (primarily IfcDistributionElement subtypes) where _IfcPropertySetTemplate.PropertySetType_ is PSET_PERFORMANCEDRIVEN.

In addition to standard property sets defined within this specification, if the underlying information source provides metadata (specific type information), then custom property sets may capture such data, where corresponding IfcPropertySetTemplate and IfcPropertyTemplate objects may be defined for such information to be accessed by other applications.

# IfcContext

_IfcContext_ is the generalization of a project context in which objects, type objects, property sets, and properties are defined. The _IfcProject_ as subtype of _IfcContext_ provides the context for all information on a construction project, it may include one or several _IfcProjectLibrary_'s as subtype of _IfcContext_ to register the included libraries for the project. A library of products that is referenced is declared within the _IfcProjectLibrary_ as the context of that library.
<!-- end of short definition -->

Context definitions can be named, using the inherited _Name_ attribute, which should be a user-recognizable key or number for the context. The _LongName_ can add a full name. Further explanations to the context can be given using the inherited _Description_ attribute.

A Context is declared by the relationship object _IfcRelDeclares_ that refers to the corresponding objects within the context. More specific relationships are introduced at the level of subtypes.

# IfcGroup

_IfcGroup_ is a generalization of any arbitrary group. A group is a logical collection of objects. It does not have its own position, nor can it hold its own shape representation. Therefore a group is an aggregation under some non-geometrical / topological grouping aspects.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> EXAMPLE An example for a group is a system, since it groups elements under the aspect of their role, regardless of their position in a building. One of the most important usages of a group representing a system is the _IfcDistributionSystem_, that groups distribution components, such as space heaters and valves into a heating system.

A group can hold any collection of objects, the relationship _IfcRelAssignsToGroup_ is used to establish the group collection. Objects within a group are products, processes, controls, resources, actors or other groups, thus groups can be nested. An object can be part of zero, one, or many groups. Grouping relationships are not required to be hierarchical nor do they imply a dependency.

A group can be referenced in a spatial structure using the relationship _IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure_, such as a mechanical distribution system that refers to a building.

Groups are assigned to other objects (such as a process or a resource) by the relationship object that refers to the corresponding object:

* Process: assigned using _IfcRelAssignsToProcess_
* Resource: assigned using _IfcRelAssignsToResource_
* Controls: affecting the group using _IfcRelAssignsToControl_

A group can be exchanged without having already objects within the group collection.

_IfcGroup_ does not define an own object coordinate system, nor does it have an independent shape representation.

# IfcObject

An _IfcObject_ is the generalization of any semantically treated thing or process. Objects are things as they appear - i.e. occurrences.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> NOTE Examples of _IfcObject_ include physically tangible items such as wall, beam or covering, physically existing items such as spaces, or conceptual items such as grids or virtual boundaries. It also stands for processes such as work tasks, for controls such as cost items, or for actors such as persons involved in the design process.

Objects can be named, using the inherited _Name_ attribute, which should be a user-recognizable label for the object occurrence. Further explanations to the object can be given using the inherited _Description_ attribute. The _ObjectType_ attribute is used:

* to store the user defined value for all subtypes of _IfcObject_, where a _PredefinedType_ attribute is given, and its value is set to USERDEFINED.
* to provide a type information (could be seen as a very lightweight classifier) of the subtype of _IfcObject_, if no _PredefinedType_ attribute is given. This is often the case, if no comprehensive list of predefined types is available.

Objects are independent pieces of information that might contain or reference other pieces of information. There are several relationships in which objects can be involved:

* **Association to external/internal resource information** - an association relationship that refers to external/internal sources of information. See supertype _IfcObjectDefinition_ for more information.
* **Assignment of other objects** - an assignment relationship that refers to other types of objects. See supertype _IfcObjectDefinition_ for more information.
* **Aggregation of other objects** - an aggregation relationship that establishes a whole/part relation. Objects can either be a whole, or a part, or both. See supertype _IfcObjectDefinition_ for more information.
* **Assignment of a type** : _IsTypedBy_ - a definition relationship _IfcRelDefinesByType_ that uses a type definition to define the common characteristics of this occurrence, potentially including the common shape representation and common properties of all object occurrences assigned to this type. It is a specific - occurrence relationship with implied dependencies (as the occurrence properties depend on the properties of the type, but may override them).
* **Assignment of a partial type** : _IsDeclaredBy_, _Declares_ - a definition relationship _IfcRelDefinesByObject_ that uses a component of a type definition (a part of a type, called the "declaring part") to define a component of an occurrence (part of occurrence, called the "reflected part"). This is also referred to as a "deep copy". The common characteristics of all parts in the occurrence are defined by parts in the type. It is a specific - occurrence relationship with implied dependencies (as the occurrence properties depend on the properties of the type, but may override them).
* **Assignment of property sets** : _IsDefinedBy_ - a definition relationship _IfcRelDefinesByProperties_ that assigns property set definitions to the object occurrence.

> NOTE See _IfcRelDefinesByType_ for an explanatory figure. Also see there for how to override type properties by occurrence properties. See _IfcRelDefinesByObject_ for an explanatory figure for the assignment of a partial type.

> HISTORY New entity in IFC1.0

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE The inverse relationships _Declares_, _IsDeclaredBy_, and _IsTypedBy_ have been added. Types are no longer included in the _IsDefinesBy_ relationship. _IfcProject_ has been promoted to be a subtype of _IfcObjectDefinition_ -> _IfcContext_.

**Informal Propositions**

1. A partial type assignment, i.e. the inverse attribute _IsDeclaredBy_, or _Declares_ shall only be used, if the object is part of a decomposition, i.e. if either _IsDecomposedBy_, or _Decomposes_ is exerted.

## Attributes

### ObjectType
The type denotes a particular type that indicates the object further. The use has to be established at the level of instantiable subtypes. In particular it holds the user defined type, if the enumeration of the attribute _PredefinedType_ is set to USERDEFINED or when the concrete entity instantiated does not have a PredefinedType attribute. The latter is the case in some exceptional leaf classes and when instantiating IfcBuiltElement directly. 

### IsDeclaredBy
Link to the relationship object pointing to the declaring object that provides the object definitions for this object occurrence. The declaring object has to be part of an object type decomposition. The associated _IfcObject_, or its subtypes, contains the specific information (as part of a type, or style, definition), that is common to all reflected instances of the declaring _IfcObject_, or its subtypes.
{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE New inverse relationship, change made with upward compatibility for file based exchange.

### Declares
Link to the relationship object pointing to the reflected object(s) that receives the object definitions. The reflected object has to be part of an object occurrence decomposition.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE New inverse relationship, change made with upward compatibility for file based exchange.

### IsTypedBy
Set of relationships to the object type that provides the type definitions for this object occurrence. The then associated _IfcTypeObject_, or its subtypes, contains the specific information (or type, or style), that is common to all instances of _IfcObject_, or its subtypes, referring to the same type.
{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE New inverse relationship, the link to _IfcRelDefinesByType_ was previously included in the inverse relationship _IfcRelDefines_. Change made with upward compatibility for file based exchange.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE The data type has been changed from _IfcRelDefines_ to _IfcRelDefinesByProperties_ with upward compatibility for file based exchange.

## Formal Propositions

### UniquePropertySetNames
Every individual _IfcPropertySetDefinition_ assigned to the object using _IfcRelDefinesByProperties_ shall have a unique _Name_ attribute value.

## Concepts

### Object Predefined Type



### Object Typing

Any object occurrence can be typed by being assigned to a common object type utilizing this concept. A particular rule, restricting the applicable subtypes of _IfcTypeObject_ that can be assigned, is introduced by overriding this concept at the level of subtypes of _IfcObject_.

### Object User Identity

An attribute _Name_ and optionally _Description_ can be used for all subypes of _IfcObject_. For those subtypes, that have an object type definition, such as _IfcBeam_ - _IfcBeamType_, the common _Name_ and optionally _Description_ is associated with the object type.

### Property Sets with Override

Any object occurrence can hold property sets, either directly at the object occurrence as element specific property sets, or at the object type, as type property sets. In this case, the properties that are provided to the object occurrence are the combinations of element specific and type properties. In case that the same property (within the same property set) is defined both in occurrence and type properties, the property value of the occurrence property overrides the property value of the type property.

# IfcObjectDefinition

An _IfcObjectDefinition_ is the generalization of any semantically treated thing or process, either being a type or an occurrence. Object definitions can be named, using the inherited _Name_ attribute, which should be a user-recognizable label for the object occurrence. Further explanations to the object can be given using the inherited _Description_ attribute. A context is a specific kind of object definition as it provides the project or library context in which object types and object occurrences are defined.
<!-- end of short definition -->

Objects are independent pieces of information that might contain or reference other pieces of information. There are five essential kinds of relationships in which object definitions (by their instantiable subtypes) can be involved:

* **Assignment of other objects** - an assignment relationship (_IfcRelAssigns_) that refers to other types of objects and creates a bi-directional association. The semantic of the assignment is established at the level of the subtypes of the general _IfcRelAssigns_ relationship. There is no dependency implied a priori by the assignment.
* **Association to external resources** - an association relationship (_IfcRelAssociates_) that refers to external sources of information (most notably a classification or document) and creates a uni-directional association. There is no dependency implied by the association.
* **Aggregation of other objects** - an aggregation relationship (_IfcRelAggregates_) that establishes an unordered, spatial whole/part relation and creates a bi-directional relation. There is an implied dependency established.
* **Nesting of other objects** - a nesting relationship (_IfcRelNests_) that establishes an ordered, non-spatial whole/part relation and creates a bi-directional relation. There is an implied dependency established.
* **Declaration within a context** - a relationship (_IfcRelDeclares_) of the uppermost object definition within the object definition tree (e.g. the summary object within an object nesting tree) to the context (a project or project library). It applies the units, representation context and other context information to this object definition and all dependent ones.

> NOTE The link between the uppermost object in the spatial structure tree, that is _IfcSite_ or _IfcBuilding_, and the context provided by _IfcProject_ is created using the _IfcRelAggregates_ relationship. See _IfcProject_ for more information.

> HISTORY New abstract entity in IFC2x3.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE The new subtype _IfcContext_ and the relationship to context _HasContext_ has been added. The decomposition relationship is split into ordered nesting (_Nests_, _IsNestedBy_) and un-ordered aggregating (_Decomposes_, _IsDecomposedBy_).

## Attributes

### HasAssignments
Reference to the relationship objects, that assign (by an association relationship) other subtypes of _IfcObject_ to this object instance. Examples are the association to products, processes, controls, resources or groups.

### Nests

Process information relates to other objects by establishing the following relationships:

* **Nesting of processes** : _IfcRelNests_ - A process can contain sub processes and thereby be nested.
* **Sequencing of processes** : _IfcRelSequence_ - Processes can be placed in sequence (including overlapping for parallel tasks), and have predecessors and successors.
* **Assigning process to schedules** : _IfcRelAssignsToControl_ - Activities such as tasks, and predominately summary tasks, are assigned to a work schedule.
* **Having a product assigned to the process as input** : _IfcRelAssignsToProcess_ - Products can be assigned as input to a process, such as for construction process planning.
* **Having a product assigned to the process as output** : _IfcRelAssignsToProduct_ - Products can be assigned as output to a process, such as for construction process planning.
* **Having a control assigned to the process as process control** : _IfcRelAssignsToProcess_ - Items that act as a control onto the process can be assigned to a process, such as for cost management (a cost item assigned to a work task).

# IfcProduct

The _IfcProduct_ is an abstract representation of any object that relates to a geometric or spatial context. An _IfcProduct_ occurs at a specific location in space if it has a geometric representation assigned. It can be placed relatively to other products, but ultimately relative to the project coordinate system. The _ObjectPlacement_ attribute establishes the coordinate system in which all points and directions used by the geometric representation items under _Representation_ are founded. The _Representation_ is provided by an _IfcProductDefinitionShape_ being either a geometric shape representation, or a topology representation (with or without underlying geometry of the topological items).
<!-- end of short definition -->

Products include manufactured, supplied or created objects (referred to as elements) for incorporation into an AEC/FM project. This also includes objects that are created indirectly by other products, as spaces are defined by bounding elements. Products can be designated for permanent use or temporary use, an example of the latter is formwork. Products are defined by their properties and representations.

In addition to physical products (covered by the subtype _IfcElement_) and spatial items (covered by the subtype _IfcSpatialElement_) the _IfcProduct_ also includes non-physical items, that relate to a geometric or spatial context, such as grid, port, annotation, structural actions, etc.

Any instance of _IfcProduct_ defines a particular occurrence of a product. The common type information, that relates to many similar (or identical) occurrences of _IfcProduct_, is handled by the _IfcTypeProduct_ (and its subtypes), assigned to one or many occurrences of _IfcProduct_ by using the objectified relationship _IfcRelDefinesByType_. The _IfcTypeProduct_ may provide, in addition to common properties, also a common geometric representation for all occurrences.

> NOTE See _IfcTypeProduct_ for how to use a common geometric representation and _IfcRelDefinesByType_ for using and overriding common properties.

On a generic level products can be assigned to processes, controls, resources, project by using the relationship objects that refer to the corresponding object:

* **Having a control applied**: assigned using _IfcRelAssignsToControl_ linking the _IfcProduct_ to an _IfcControl_
* **Being assigned to a process**: assigned using _IfcRelAssignsToProcess_ linking the _IfcProduct_ to an _IfcProcess_
* **Being assigned to a resource**: assigned using _IfcRelAssignsToResource_ linking the _IfcProduct_ to an _IfcResource_

An example of process assignment relationship is the assignment of products like wall, slab, and column to a construction task for construction planning. An example of resource assignment relationship is the assignment of products to a construction resource that consumes the product.

## Attributes

### ObjectPlacement
This establishes the object coordinate system and placement of the product in space. The placement can either be absolute (relative to the world coordinate system), relative (relative to the object placement of another product), or constrained (e.g. relative to grid axes, or to a linear positioning element). The type of placement is determined by the various subtypes of _IfcObjectPlacement_. An object placement must be provided if a representation is present.

### Representation
Reference to the representations of the product, being either a representation (_IfcProductRepresentation_) or as a special case of a shape representation (_IfcProductDefinitionShape_). The product definition shape provides for multiple geometric representations of the shape property of the object within the same object coordinate system, defined by the object placement.

### ReferencedBy
Reference to the _IfcRelAssignsToProduct_ relationship, by which other products, processes, controls, resources or actors (as subtypes of _IfcObjectDefinition_) can be related to this product.

### PositionedRelativeTo
Reference to the _IfcRelPositions_ relationship, which defines its relationship with a positioning element.

### ReferencedInStructures
Reference to the objectified relationship _IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure_ may be used to relate a product to one or more spatial structure elements in addition to the one in which it is primarily contained.

## Formal Propositions

### PlacementForShapeRepresentation
If a _Representation_ is given being an _IfcProductDefinitionShape_, then also an _ObjectPlacement_ has to be given. The _ObjectPlacement_ defines the object coordinate system in which the geometric representation items of the _IfcProductDefinitionShape_ are founded.

> NOTE If the _Representation_ of several subtypes of _IfcProduct_ have the same coordinate system it is permitted to share an instance of _IfcObjectPlacement_.

## Concepts

### Body Geometry

The body or solid model geometric representation of an _IfcProduct_ is typically defined using a Tessellation or Brep. Subtypes may provide recommendations on other representation types that may be used. The following attribute values for the _IfcShapeRepresentation_ holding this geometric representation shall be used:

* _IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationIdentifier_ = 'Body'
* _IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationType_ = Typically 'Tessellation' or 'Brep'

### Product Geometric Representation

The geometric representation of any _IfcProduct_ is provided by the _IfcProductDefinitionShape_ allowing multiple geometric representations. It uses the _Product Placement_ concept utilizing _IfcLocalPlacement_ to establish an object coordinate system, in which all geometric representations are founded.

> NOTE A detailed specification of how to apply the local placement and which shape representations are applicable is provided at the level of subtypes of _IfcProduct_ and is further determined by the model view definition and implementer agreements.

### Product Geometry Colour



### Product Geometry Layer



### Product Relative Positioning

If the _IfcProduct_ _Product Placement_ is placed relative to an _IfcPositioningElement_ this relationship covers the information on which _IfcPositioningElement_ positions the _IfcProduct_.

# IfcProject

_IfcProject_ establishes the context for information to be exchanged or shared, and it may represent a construction project but does not have to. The _IfcProject_'s main purpose in an exchange structure is to provide the root instance and the context for all other information items included.
<!-- end of short definition -->

The context provided by the _IfcProject_ includes:

* the default units
* the geometric representation context for exchange structures including shape representations
  * the project coordinate system
  * the coordinate space dimension
  * the precision used within the geometric representations
  * optionally the indication of the true north
  * optionally the map conversion between the project coordinate system and the geospatial coordinate reference system.

> HISTORY New entity in IFC1.0

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE The attributes _RepresentationContexts_ and _UnitsInContext_ are made optional and are promoted to supertype _IfcContext_.

## Formal Propositions

There shall be at most one project within the exchange context. This is enforced by the global rule _IfcSingleProjectInstance_.

### HasName
The _Name_ attribute has to be provided for _IfcProject_. It is the short name for the project.

### CorrectContext
If a _RepresentationContexts_ relation is provided then there shall be no instance of _IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext_ directly included in the set of _RepresentationContexts_.

### NoDecomposition
The _IfcProject_ represents the root of any decomposition tree. It shall therefore not be used to decompose any other object definition.

## Concepts

### Project Classification Information



### Project Declaration

The _IfcProject_ is also the context for other information about the construction project such as a work plan. Non-product structures are assigned by their first level object to _IfcProject_ using the IfcRelDeclares relationship. The _IfcProject_ provides the context for work plans (or other non-product based) descriptions of the construction project. It is handled by the objectified relationship _IfcRelDeclares_.

> NOTE The spatial structure and the schedule structure can be decomposed. For example the _IfcBuilding_ can be decomposed into _IfcBuildingStorey_ entities, and the _IfcWorkPlan_ can be decomposed into _IfcWorkSchedule_ entities.

> NOTE The products and tasks can be decomposed further. For example the _IfcCurtainWall_ can be decomposed into _IfcMember_ and _IfcPlate_, the _IfcTask_ can be decomposed into other _IfcTask_ entities.

> NOTE The products and tasks can have direct linking relationships. For example the _IfcCurtainWall_ can be assigned to an _IfcTask_ as an input or output for a construction schedule.

### Spatial Decomposition

The _IfcProject_ is used to reference the root of the spatial structure of a building or other construction project (that serves as the primary project breakdown and is required to be hierarchical). The spatial structure elements are linked together, and to the _IfcProject_, by using the objectified relationship _IfcRelAggregates_.

The following constraints are applied to using the relationship _IfcRelAggregates_ in context of _IfcProject_

Examples of project libraries include:

* type libraries (also called style or family libraries): a collection of subtypes of _IfcTypeObject_
* property definition libraries: a collection of _IfcPropertySetTemplate_ or _IfcPropertyTemplate_ entities

The inherited attributes _RepresentationContext_ and _UnitsInContext_ have the following meaning:

* Context of the representations used within the project library. When the project library includes shape representations for its library type objects, one or several geometric representation contexts need to be included that define the coordinate system, the coordinate space dimensions, and/or the precision factor,
* Units locally assigned to measure types used within the context of this project library.

> NOTE It is generally discouraged to use a different length measure and plane angle measure in an included project library compared with the project itself. It may lead to unexpected results for the shape representation of items included in the project library.

Instances of _IfcProjectLibrary_ are assigned to the project context using the _IfcRelDeclares_ relationship and accessible through the inverse attribute _HasContext_. Individual object types and property (set) templates are assigned to the _IfcProjectLibrary_ using the _IfcRelDeclares_ relationship and are accessible through the inverse attribute _Declares_.

# IfcPropertySet

The _IfcPropertySet_ is a container that holds properties within a property tree. These properties are interpreted according to their name attribute. Each individual property has a significant name string. Some property sets are included in the specification of this standard and have a predefined set of properties indicated by assigning a significant name. These property sets are listed under "property sets" within this specification. Property sets applicable to certain objects are listed in the object specification. The naming convention "Pset_Xxx" applies to all those property sets that are defined as part of this specification and it shall be used as the value of the _Name_ attribute.
<!-- end of short definition -->

In addition any user defined property set can be captured. Property sets that are not declared as part of the IFC specification shall have a _Name_ value not including the "Pset_" prefix.

_IfcPropertySet_ can be assigned to object occurrences and object types. An _IfcPropertySet_ assigned to an object type is shared among all occurrences of the same object type.

> NOTE See _IfcRelDefinesByType_ for how to override property sets assigned to an object type within the object occurrence.

An _IfcPropertySetTemplate_ may define the underlying structure, i.e. the required name, the applicable object or object types to which the property set can be attached, and the individual properties that can be included. Property sets are related to other objects by using the relationship object that refers to the corresponding object:

* **Occurrence Object**: _IfcRelDefinesByProperties_ using the inverse attribute _DefinesOccurrence_.

# IfcPropertySetDefinition

_IfcPropertySetDefinition_ is a generalization of all individual property sets that can be assigned to an object or type object. The property set definition can be either:

* **Dynamically extendable property sets** - _IfcPropertySet_, a set of properties for which the IFC specification only provides a kind of "meta model", to be further declared by agreement. This means no entity definition of the properties exists within the IFC specification. The declaration is done by assigning a significant string value to the _Name_ attribute of the entity as defined in the entity _IfcPropertySet_ and at each subtype of _IfcProperty_, referenced by the property set. Dynamically defined property sets may have an underlying template provided by _IfcPropertySetTemplate_.
* **Statically defined property sets** - _IfcPreDefinedPropertySet_, a property set entity that exists within the IFC specification. The semantic meaning of each statically defined property set is declared by its entity type and the meaning of the properties is defined by the name and data type of the explicit attribute representing it.
<!-- end of short definition -->

Property set definitions define information that is shared among multiple instances of objects, either object occurrences or object types. _IfcPropertySetDefinition_'s (by their instantiable subtypes) can participate within the following relationships:

* **Assignment to object types** - an _DefinesType_ direct relationship to _IfcTypeObject_ that applies the property set, with all included properties, to the object type. Those properties apply to all object occurrences having the same object type.
* **Assignment to object occurrences** - an _DefinesOccurrence_ relationship to _IfcRelDefinesByProperties_ that applies the property set, with all included properties, to the object occurrence.

# IfcPropertySetTemplate

_IfcPropertySetTemplate_ defines the template for all dynamically extensible property sets represented by _IfcPropertySet_. The property set template is a container of property templates within a property tree. The individual property templates are interpreted according to their _Name_ attribute and shall have no values assigned.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> NOTE By convention an _IfcPropertySetTemplate_ can also be used as a template for an _IfcElementQuantity_, being a particular type of a property set definition.

Property set templates can form part of a property library used and declared within a project. Depending on the _TemplateType_ the _IfcPropertySetTemplate_ defines a template for:

* "Pset_" - occurrences of _IfcPropertySet_
* "Qto_" - occurrences of _IfcElementQuantity_

The inherited _HasContext_ inverse relation to _IfcRelDeclares_ is used to declare the _IfcPropertySetTemplate_ within a project library. If included in an exchange data set it can then be traversed through the _IfcProjectLibrary_. The _Defines_ inverse relation to _IfcRelDefinesByTemplate_ is provided to keep the definition relationship between the _IfcPropertySetTemplate_ and the one to many _IfcPropertySet_'s, for which it provides the template. Figure 1 illustrates relationships used for property set templates.

Between _IfcProperty_'s within the _HasProperties_ set of _IfcPropertySet_ having the same _Name_ attribute value as the _IfcPropertyTemplate_'s within the _HasPropertyTemplates_ set of _IfcPropertySetTemplate_ an implicit definition relationship is established that assigns the template to the individual properties.

### TemplateType
Property set type defining whether the property set is applicable to a type (subtypes of _IfcTypeObject_), to an occurrence (subtypes of _IfcObject_), or as a special case to a performance history.

The attribute _ApplicableEntity_ may further refine the applicability to a single or multiple entity type(s).

### ApplicableEntity
The attribute optionally defines the data type of the applicable type or occurrence object, to which the assigned property set template can relate. If not present, no instruction is given to which type or occurrence object the property set template is applicable. The following conventions are used:

* The IFC entity name of the applicable entity using the IFC naming convention, CamelCase with `Ifc` prefix
* It can be optionally followed by the predefined type after the separator "/" (forward slash), using upper case
* If a performance history object of a particular distribution object is attributed by the property set template, then the entity name (and potentially amended by the predefined type) is expanded by adding '[PerformanceHistory]'
* If one property set template is applicable to many type and/or occurrence objects, then those object names should be separated by comma "," forming a comma-separated string.

> EXAMPLE Referring to a boiler type as applicable entity would be expressed as 'IfcBoilerType', referring to a steam boiler type as applicable entity would be expressed as 'IfcBoilerType/STEAM', referring to a wall and a wall type would be expressed as 'IfcWall, IfcWallType'. An applicable _IfcPerformanceHistory_ assigned to an occurrence or type object would be indicated by IfcBoilerType[PerformanceHistory], or respectively IfcBoilerType/STEAM[PerformanceHistory].

The assignment relationship, _IfcRelAssigns_, is a generalization of "link" relationships among instances of _IfcObject_ and its various 1<sup>st</sup> level subtypes. A link denotes the specific association through which one object (the client) applies the services of other objects (the suppliers), or through which one object may navigate to other objects.
<!-- end of short definition -->

The client is denoted as the relating object and is established at the level of the specific, instantiable subtypes of _IfcRelAssigns_. The suppliers are denoted as the related objects and they are established by the _RelatedObjects_ attribute.

The association relationship _IfcRelAssociates_ refers to sources of information (most notably a classification, library, document, approval, constraint, or material). The information associated may reside internally or externally to the project data. There is no dependency implied by the association.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> EXAMPLE Further external information may be provided to the tank equipment (as subtype of _IfcProduct_) in terms of its classification and instruction documents, the source of the additional information is held external to the project data model.

Association relationships can be established to objects (occurrences as subtypes of _IfcObject_) or to types (as subtypes of _IfcTypeObject_). Some associations (such as approval, or document) may also be applied to property templates (as subtypes of _IfcPropertyDefinition_).

> EXAMPLE The classification information for the storage tank equipment may be associated to the _IfcTankType_ (subtype of _IfcTypeObject_), defining the specific information for all occurences of that tank in the project. Therefore the association of the Uniclass notation 'Pr_60_50_10' may be associated by a subtype of _IfcRelAssociates_ to the type information.

<!-- end of short definition -->

Decompositions may be constrained by requiring both the whole and its parts, to be of the same type - thus establishing a nesting relationship. Or they may require some form of physical containment, thus establishing special types of aggregation relationships.

Decompositions imply a dependency, i.e. the definition of the whole depends on the definition of the parts and the parts depend on the existence of the whole.

Those objects then share the same object type, and the property sets and properties assigned to the object type.

The _IfcRelDefinesByType_ links the object type definition with the object occurrence. Both the object type and the object occurrence may define properties by assigning an _IfcPropertySet_, including one or many subtypes of _IfcProperty_ to either the object type or object occurrence, as shown in Figure 1.

There are several scenarios to define the same property set on the object type definition and object occurrence side:

1. All properties for all object occurrences of a common object type have the same value - then only the object type definition has a property set assigned.
2. All properties for all object occurrences are different, that is there are no common property values for the object type definition - then each of the object occurrences has a property set assigned.
3. Some properties within the same property set have common values and are assigned to the object type definition and some are occurrence specific and assigned (with potentially different values) to the object occurrences - then:
  * The sum of all properties within a given property set applicable to an object occurrence is the union of properties assigned to the object type definition, plus the properties assigned to the object occurrence.
  * If the object occurrence has a property with the same _IfcProperty.Name_ in an _IfcPropertySet_, as the corresponding object type definition, then the property value defined at the occurrence overrides the value defined at the type.

# IfcResource

_IfcResource_ contains the information needed to represent the costs, schedule, and other impacts resulting from the use of a thing in a process. It is not intended to use _IfcResource_ to model the general properties of the things themselves, while an optional linkage from _IfcResource_ to the things being used can be specified (specifically, the relationship from subtypes of _IfcResource_ to _IfcProduct_ through the _IfcRelAssignsToResource_ relationship).
<!-- end of short definition -->

There are two basic intended uses of _IfcResource_. First, if the attributes of the thing are not needed for the purpose of the use of _IfcResource_, or the types of things are not explicitly modeled in IFC yet, then the linkage between the resource and the thing doesn't have to be instantiated in the system. That is, the attributes of _IfcResource_ (or its subtypes) alone are sufficient to represent the use of the thing as a resource for the purpose of the project.

> EXAMPLE Construction equipment such as earth-moving vehicles or tools are not currently modeled within the IFC. For the purpose of estimating and scheduling, these can be represented using subtypes of _IfcResource_ alone.

Second, if the attributes of the thing are needed for the use of _IfcResource_ objects, and they are modeled explicitly as objects, then the _IfcResource_ instances can be linked to the instances of the type of the things being referenced. Things that might be used as resources and that are already modeled in the IFC include physical products, people and organizations, and materials. The relationship object _IfcRelAssignsToResource_ is provided for this approach.

# IfcRoot

_IfcRoot_ is the most abstract and root class for all entity definitions that are rooted in the kernel or in subsequent layers of the IFC specification. It is therefore the common supertype of all IFC entities, except for those defined in an IFC resource schema. All entities that are subtypes of _IfcRoot_ can be used independently, whereas resource schema entities, that are not subtypes of _IfcRoot_, are not supposed to be independent entities.

# IfcSimplePropertyTemplate

The _IfcSimplePropertyTemplate_ defines the template for all dynamically extensible properties, either the subtypes of _IfcSimpleProperty_ or the subtypes of _IfcPhysicalSimpleQuantity_. The individual property templates are interpreted according to their _Name_ attribute and may have a predefined template type, property units, and property measure types. The correct interpretation of the attributes:

* _PrimaryUnit_
* _SecondaryUnit_
* _PrimaryMeasureType_
* _SecondaryMeasureType_
<!-- end of short definition -->

is determined by the _TemplateType_. The attributes Enumerators and Expression only apply to instances of _IfcSimplePropertyTemplate_ having a particular _TemplateType_. The _TemplateType_ also controls which subtype of either _IfcSimpleProperty_ or _IfcPhysicalSimpleQuantity_ shall be used for property occurrences corresponding to this template.

The _IfcSimplePropertyTemplate_ is part of the set of templates included in the _IfcPropertySetTemplate_. The template can be accessed through the inverse attribute _PartOfPsetTemplate_. The _IfcPropertySetTemplate_ may define one or several instances of _IfcPropertySet_ (or _IfcElementQuantity_). The definition assignment is established by the objectified relationship _IfcRelDefinesByTemplate_ as shown in Figure 1. There is no direct link between an _IfcSimplePropertyTemplate_ and a subtype of either _IfcSimpleProperty_ or _IfcPhysicalSimpleQuantity_. The definition relationship between the template and the individual properties (or quantities) is established by the _Name_ attributes.

> NOTE Constraints at _IfcPropertySetTemplate_ and _IfcPropertySet_ (and _IfcElementQuantity_) guarantee that the _Name_ attributes of included property templates and individual properties are unique.

# IfcTypeObject

The object type defines the specific information about a type, which is common to all occurrences of this type. It refers to the specific level of the well-recognized _generic - specific - occurrence_ modeling paradigm. The _IfcTypeObject_ gets assigned to the individual object instances (the occurrences) via the _IfcRelDefinesByType_ relationship.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> NOTE The terms 'Type' and 'Style' are often used interchangeably.

The object type is represented by a set of property set definitions. The attached property sets describe the available alphanumeric information about the object type and are used to define all common properties that apply to all object occurrences of that type.

> NOTE If a property having the same name is used within the _IfcPropertySet_ assigned to an _IfcTypeObject_ (and subtypes) and to an occurrence of that type, then the occurrence property overrides the type property. See _IfcRelDefinesByType_ for an explanatory figure.

Object types may be exchanged without being already assigned to objects. An object type may have an indication of the library (or catalogue) from which its definition originates. This association is handled by the inherited _HasAssociations_ relationship pointing to _IfcRelAssociatesLibrary_.

> IFC4 CHANGE The entity _IfcTypeObject_ shall not be instantiated from IFC4 onwards. It will be changed into an ABSTRACT supertype in future releases of IFC. The inverse attribute _Types_ has been renamed from _ObjectTypeOf_.

## Attributes

### ApplicableOccurrence
The attribute optionally defines the data type of the occurrence object, to which the assigned type object can relate. If not present, no restriction is given regarding which occurrence object the type object is applicable to. The following conventions are used:

* The IFC entity name of the applicable occurrence using the IFC naming convention (CamelCase with "Ifc" prefix).
* Optionally followed by the predefined type after a “/” (forward slash), in uppercase.
* If one type object is applicable to many occurrence objects, then those occurrence object names should be separated by commas "," forming a comma separated string.

> EXAMPLE Referring to a furniture as applicable occurrence entity would be expressed as 'IfcFurnishingElement', referring to a brace as applicable entity would be expressed as 'IfcMember/BRACE'.

### HasPropertySets
Set of unique property sets that are associated with the object type and are common to all object occurrences referring to this object type.
{ .change-ifc2x3}

# IfcTypeProduct

_IfcTypeProduct_ defines a type definition of a product without being already inserted into a project structure (without having a placement), and not being included in the geometric representation context of the project. It is used to define a product specification, that is, the specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that product type.
<!-- end of short definition -->

An _IfcTypeProduct_ may have a list of property sets attached and an optional set of product representations. Values of these properties and the representation maps are common to all occurrences of that product type. The type-occurrence relationship is realized using the objectified relationship _IfcRelDefinesByType_.

> NOTE The product representations are defined as representation maps, which may be assigned by a product instance through the representation item(s) being an _IfcShapeRepresentation_ and having _Items_ of type _IfcMappedItem_.

The representations at the occurrence level (represented by subtypes of _IfcProduct_) can override the specific representations at the type level:

* for geometric representations, a Cartesian transformation operator can be applied at the occurrence level.
* for property sets, a property within an occurrence property set, assigned at the product occurrence, overrides the same property assigned to the product type.

An _IfcTypeProduct_ may be exchanged without being already assigned to subtypes of _IfcProduct_.

List of unique representation maps. Each representation map describes a block definition of the shape of the product style. By providing more than one representation map, a multi-view block definition can be given.

### Tag
The tag (or label) identifier at the particular type of a product, e.g. the article number (like the EAN). It is the identifier at the specific level.

## Formal Propositions

### ApplicableOccurrence
The product type (or style), if assigned to an object, shall only be assigned to an object being a sub type of _IfcProduct_.

## Concepts

### Library Association



### Product Type Shape

The _RepresentationMaps_ define the type product shape and multiple geometric representations can be assigned. If a product occurrence is assigned to the type by using the _IfcRelDefinesByType_ relationship, then these occurrences have to reference the representation maps. The reference is created by one or multiple _IfcShapeRepresentation_'s having an _IfcMappedItem_ as _Items_, that places the _IfcRepresentationMap_ of the type product into the spatial contexts, i.e. by using a Cartesian transformation operator to transform the _IfcRepresentationMap_ into the object coordinate system of the product occurrence.

Figure 1 illustrates an example of referencing a representation map by the shape representation of a product occurrence. Here the Cartesian transformation operator only uses translation, but no rotation, mirroring, or scaling.

Figure 1 — Product type geometry with single placement

Figure 2 illustrates an example of referencing a representation multiple times by the shape representation of a product occurrence. Here the Cartesian transformation operator only uses translation, but no rotation, mirroring, or scaling. The different translation values determine the pattern of the multiple placement.

IfcKernel
=========

The schema _IfcKernel_ defines the most abstract part or core part of the specification. It captures general constructs, that are basically founded by their different semantic meaning in common understanding of an object model, like object, property and relationship. Those are then specialized into non-AEC/FM specific constructs, like product, process, control and resource, which form the main entry points for the next level within the schema architecture, the Core Extension layer.

The _IfcKernel_ also specifies the basic attributes and relationships, such as relative location of products in space, sequence of processes in time, or general purpose grouping and nesting mechanisms. It also lays the foundation of extensibility of the specification by providing:

* proxy definitions;
* type object definitions;
* property set definitions;
* property set template definitions.

#### 5.1.1.1 Root definition
Each entity defined outside of the Resource layer of the schema architecture inherits directly or indirectly from the _IfcRoot_ entity. _IfcRoot_ provides for the fundamental capabilities of:

* identification - assigning a globally unique identifier (the GUID)
* optional ownership and change information
* optional name and description attribution

There are three fundamental entity types in the IFC model, which are all derived from _IfcRoot_. They form the first level of specialization within the entity hierarchy.

* object definitions are the generalization of any semantically treated thing (or item) within the IFC model.
* relationships are the generalization of all relationships among things (or items) that are treated as objectified relationships between different entities
* property definitions are the generalization of all characteristics that may be assigned to object definitions.

#### 5.1.1.2 Object definitions
An object definition is the abstract supertype, _IfcObjectDefinition_, and stands for all physically tangible items, such as wall, beam or covering, physically existing items, such as spaces, or conceptual items, such as grids or virtual boundaries. It also stands for processes such as work tasks, for controls such as cost items, for resources such as labor resource, or for actors such as persons involved in the design process.

Object definitions are specialized into object occurrences, _IfcObject_, indicating any individual object in space, time or another representation context, into object types, _IfcTypeObject_ indicating the common definitions as a type, or article that are identical for all object occurrences, and basic project or library context, _IfcContext_.

An object and object type gets its information from the relationships in which it is involved. This includes the definition relationship to property information, or the typing relationship to assign an underlying object type to an object.

#### 5.1.1.3 Relationship definitions
Relationships are predominately being defined as the objectified relationship, _IfcRelationship_. The objectified relationship handles relationships among objects. This allows to keep relationship specific properties directly at the relationship object and to uncouple the relationship semantics from the object attributes.

The introduction of the objectified relationships also allows the development of a separate subtype tree for relationship semantics.

#### 5.1.1.4 Property definition
The property definition, _IfcPropertyDefinition_, is the generalization of all characteristics of objects. Shared among multiple object instances, it reflects the specific information of an object type, but it may also represent the occurrence information of the actual object in the project context, if it is assigned only to a single object instance.

The property definition gets applied to the objects using the concept of relationships.

#### 5.1.1.5 Object entity subtype tree
There are six fundamental entity types in the IFC model, which are all derived from _IfcObject_.

* products - are physical object (manufactured, supplied or created) for incorporation into a project. They may be physically existing or tangible. Products may be defined by shape representations and have a location in the coordinate space.
* processes - are actions taking place in a project with the intent of acquiring, constructing, or maintaining objects. Processes are placed in sequence in time.
* controls - are concepts that control or constrain other objects. Controls can be seen as guide, specification, regulation, constraint or other requirement applied to an object that has to be fulfilled.
* resources - are concepts that describe the use of an object mainly within a process.
* actors - are human agents that are involved in a project during its full life cycle.
* groups - are arbitrary collections of objects.

#### 5.1.1.6 Relationship entity subtype tree
There are six fundamental relationship types in the IFC model, which are all derived from _IfcRelationship_. A relationship may have an informal purpose descriptor assigned, which denotes a particular purpose of applying this relationship.

* assignment - is a generalization of "link" relationships among instances of objects and its various subtypes. A link denotes the specific association through which one object (the client) applies the services of other objects (the suppliers), or through which one object may navigate to other objects.
* association - refers to external sources of information (most notably a classification, library or document) and associates it to objects or property definitions.
* decomposition - defines the general concept of elements being composed or decomposed. The decomposition relationship denotes a whole/part hierarchy with the ability to navigate from the whole (the composition) to the parts and vice versa.
* definition - uses a type definition or property set definition (seen as partial type information) to define the properties of the object instance. It is a specific - occurrence relationship
* connectivity - handles the connectivity of objects.
* declaration - handles the link between object definitions and property definitions and the declaring context.

#### 5.1.1.7 Property definition entity subtype tree
There are two fundamental concepts of property definition types, which are all derived from _IfcPropertyDefinition_.

* property and property set template - defines the syntax and data types for property sets and individual properties.
* property set occurrence - defines shareable and extensible property sets attachable to occurrences of objects. The property set is regarded as a partial type information as it establishes a subset of common shared property information among occurrence objects.

# IfcStrippedOptional

IfcStrippedOptional is a type never to be instantiated in population models, but serves a purpose for compatibility of exchanged models.
<!-- end of short definition -->

IFC-SPF (Step Physical File; ISO 10303 part 21) depends on a fixed ordering of attributes defined solely in the schema and not in the model files. This has an impact in two cases:

- **partial schema production** - When certain trees of entities are out of scope given a certain exchange, and this exchange is formalized into an EXPRESS schema, entity attributes pointing to the types that are out of scope can be changed to be of type *OPTIONAL IfcStrippedOptional* to maintain an attribute order and count in the population model that is consistent with the full EXPRESS schema.

- **type deletion from the schema** - In rare cases, types are deleted from the schema with other entities still pointing to that type. In those cases, the entity attributes pointing to the deleted type can be changed to be of type *OPTIONAL IfcStrippedOptional* to maintain a backwards compatible attribute order and count in the population model.

# IfcEvent

An _IfcEvent_ is something that happens that triggers an action or response.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> HISTORY New entity in IFC4

{ .use-head}
### Use definitions

_IfcEvent_ is used to capture information about particular things that happen or that may happen. Particularly used in work plans (or process maps) they identify e.g. a point at which a message containing information may be issued or at which a rule or constraint is invoked.

## Attributes

### PredefinedType
Identifies the predefined types of an event from which the type required may be set.

### EventTriggerType
Identifies the predefined types of event trigger from which the type required may be set.

### UserDefinedEventTriggerType
A user defined event trigger type, the value of which is asserted when the value of an event trigger type is declared as USERDEFINED.

### EventOccurenceTime
The date and/or time at which an event occurs.

## Formal Propositions

### CorrectPredefinedType
Either the _PredefinedType_ attribute is unset, or the inherited attribute _ObjectType_ must be asserted when the value of _PredefinedType_ is set to _USERDEFINED_.

### CorrectTypeAssigned
Either the _EventTriggerType_ attribute is unset, or the attribute _UserDefinedEventTriggerType_ must be asserted when the value of _EventTriggerType_ is set to _USERDEFINED_.

## Concepts

### Control Assignment

An _IfcEvent_ may be assigned to an _IfcWorkCalendar_ to indicate times when such event is active using _IfcRelAssignsToControl_; otherwise the effective calendar is determined by the nearest _IfcProcess_ ancestor with a calendar assigned.

### Object Nesting

_IfcEvent_ may be contained within an _IfcTask_ using the _IfcRelNests_ relationship. The event is considered active during the time period of the enclosing task (including any assigned _IfcWorkCalendar_); that is such event may be triggered within the task time period but not outside of it. As an _IfcEvent_ is considered to be atomic, no use is anticipated for nesting processes inside the event.

### Object Typing

The _IfcEvent_ defines the anticipated or actual occurrence of any event; common information about event types is handled by _IfcEventType_.

### Product Assignment

For building operation scenarios, _IfcEvent_ may be assigned to a product (_IfcElement_ subtype) using _IfcRelAssignsToProduct_ to indicate a specific product occurrence that sources the event.

> EXAMPLE An _IfcSensor_ for a motion sensor may have a "Motion Sensed" event. If the _IfcEvent_ is defined by an _IfcEventType_ and the _IfcEventType_ is assigned to a product type (using _IfcRelAssignsToProduct_), then the _IfcEvent_ must be assigned to one or more occurrences of the specified product type using _IfcRelAssignsToProduct_.

### Property Sets for Objects



### Sequential Connectivity

The relationship _IfcRelSequence_ is used to indicate control flow. An _IfcEvent_ as a predecessor (_IfcRelSequence.RelatingProcess_) indicates that the succeeding process (typically _IfcProcedure_ or _IfcTask_) is triggered in response to the event. An _IfcEvent_ as a successor (_IfcRelSequence.RelatedProcess_) indicates that the completion of the preceeding process causes the event to be triggered. As events have zero duration, the _IfcRelSequence.SequenceType_ attribute has no effect on an _IfcEvent_ but still applies to the opposite end of the relationship if _IfcTask_ is used.

### Use definitions

_IfcProcedure_ is used to capture information about stepped processes such as calibration, start/stop procedures for equipment items, designated actions to take in the event of an emergency etc. A procedure is not a task, but may describe a set of tasks and their order of occurrence in response to or to cause an event.

As shown in Figure 1, _IfcProcedure_ does not restrict anything but describes specific steps of how something should happen. While a procedure does control/restrict in the sense of indicating "this is how the task should be performed" by nature of describing inner detail, this is not different than parts of a product indicating "this is how the parts should be assembled". Consequently, it doesn't restrict the outer item as a whole but provides inner detail of the item.

## Attributes

### PredefinedType
Identifies the predefined types of a procedure from which
  the type required may be set.

## Formal Propositions

### CorrectPredefinedType
Either the _PredefinedType_ attribute is unset, or the inherited attribute _ObjectType_ must be asserted when the value of _PredefinedType_ is set to _USERDEFINED_.

## Concepts

### Control Assignment

An _IfcProcedure_ may be assigned to an _IfcWorkCalendar_ to indicate times when such procedure may be performed using _IfcRelAssignsToControl_; otherwise the effective calendar is determined by the nearest _IfcProcess_ ancestor with a calendar assigned. Advisory notes should be assigned to the specific _IfcProcess_ for which it gives advice using _IfcRelAssignsToProcess_.

### Object Nesting

The _IfcProcedure_ may be contained within an _IfcTask_ or _IfcProcedure_ using the _IfcRelNests_ relationship. An _IfcProcedure_ may in turn nest other _IfcProcedure_ or _IfcEvent_ entities. Such nesting indicates decomposed level of detail.

### Object Typing

_IfcProcedure_ defines the anticipated or actual occurrence of any procedure; common information about procedure types is handled by _IfcProcedureType_.

### Process Assignment

> NOTE A particular type of _IfcProcedure_ is a caution, warning or other form of advisory note. Typically, it is anticipated that such a procedure would be assigned to the specific _IfcProcess_ for which it gives advice using _IfcRelAssignsToProcess_.

### Product Assignment

For building operation scenarios, _IfcProcedure_ may be assigned to a product (_IfcElement_ subtype) using _IfcRelAssignsToProduct_ to indicate a specific product occurrence that performs the procedure.

> EXAMPLE An _IfcActuator_ may have a "Close" procedure. If the _IfcProcedure_ is defined by an _IfcProcedureType_ and the _IfcProcedureType_ is assigned to a product type (using _IfcRelAssignsToProduct_), then the _IfcProcedure_ must be assigned to one or more occurrences of the specified product type using _IfcRelAssignsToProduct_.

### Property Sets for Objects



### Sequential Connectivity

The relationship _IfcRelSequence_ is used to indicate control flow. An _IfcProcedure_ as a successor to an _IfcEvent_ indicates that the procedure should be performed in response to the event. An _IfcProcedure_ as a predecessor to an _IfcEvent_ indicates that the event should be triggered following the procedure. As procedures have arbitrary duration, the _IfcRelSequence.SequenceType_ attribute has no effect on an _IfcProcedure_ but still applies to the opposite end of the relationship if _IfcTask_ is used.

# IfcRelSequence

_IfcRelSequence_ is a sequential relationship between processes where one process must occur before the other in time and where the timing of the relationship may be described as a type of sequence. The relating process (_IfcRelSequence.RelatingProcess_) is considered to be the predecessor in the relationship (has precedence) whilst the related process (_IfcRelSequence.RelatedProcess_) is the successor.
<!-- end of short definition -->

_IfcRelSequence_ is defined as one-to-one relationship; therefore it assigns one predecessor to one successor.

> HISTORY New entity in IFC1.0.

> IFC4 CHANGE Relocated to _IfcProcessExtension_ schema. _TimeLag_ and _SequenceType_ made optional. _USERDEFINED_ added to the _IfcSequenceEnum_ enumeration. _UserDefinedSequenceType_ attribute added. WHERE rule controlling use of the _USERDEFINED_ enumeration added.

**Use definitions**

_IfcRelSequence_ is used to describe the logical sequence relationship that exists between two processes. This logical relationship identifies that there is a predecessor or relating process and a successor or related process. In IFC, there may be one predecessor and one successor in the relationship. Many occurrences of _IfcRelSequence_ may exist to describe the sequence relationships of a predecessor task with many successor tasks or of many predecessor tasks with one successor task, thus enabling a m:n sequence relationship between tasks. Please note that sequence relationships can be used to define dependencies between process occurrences but also between process types (for further information see _IfcRelDefinesByObject_ and _IfcTaskType_). In case of defining dependencies between process occurrences sequence relationships should stay within the limits of a directed, non-cyclic graph.

A sequence type may be set for a sequence. For tasks assigned to a work schedule, it is expected that the sequence type will be asserted. For a process map, where the sequence relationship between processes is simply a logical flow, it need not be asserted.

A time lag may be assigned to a sequence, and the sequence type defines the way in which the time lag applies to the sequence either as a ratio or percentage of time duration (e.g. start successor task when predecessor is 50% complete) or as a time measure (e.g. start successor task 1 week after commencement of the predecessor task). Care should be used when assigning a time lag to a sequence depending on the setting of the sequence type since there is no checking that the time lag value is in keeping with the sequence type set.

## Attributes

### RelatingProcess
Reference to the process, that is the predecessor.

### RelatedProcess
Reference to the process, that is the successor.

### TimeLag
Time duration of the sequence, it is the time lag between the predecessor and the successor as specified by the _SequenceType_.

### SequenceType
The way in which the time lag applies to the sequence.

### UserDefinedSequenceType
Allows for specification of user defined type of the sequence beyond the enumeration values (_START_START_, _START_FINISH_ _FINISH_START_, _FINISH_FINISH_) provided by _SequenceType_ attribute of type _IfcSequenceEnum_. When a value is provided for attribute _UserDefinedSequenceType_ in parallel the attribute _SequenceType_ shall have enumeration value _USERDEFINED_.

# IfcTask

An _IfcTask_ is an identifiable unit of work to be carried out in a construction project.
<!-- end of short definition -->

A task is typically used to describe an activity for the construction or installation of products, but is not limited to these types. For example it might be used to describe design processes, move operations and other design, construction and operation related activities as well.

Quantities of resources consumed by the task are dealt with by defining the _IfcElementQuantity_ for the resource and not at the instance of _IfcTask_.

> HISTORY New entity in IFC1.0. Renamed from _IfcWorkTask_ in IFC2x.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE Attributes _TaskTime_ and _PredefinedType_ added. _IfcMove_ and _IfcOrderRequest_ have been removed in IFC4 and are now represented by _IfcTask_. _IfcRelAssignsTasks_ relationship has been removed as well.

{ .use-head}
### Attribute use definition

Each occurrence of _IfcTask_ is given a name that is indicative of its content (_IfcRoot.Name_). A textual description of the task may be provided and this may be further elaborated by a narrative long description (_IfcProcess.LongDescription_). A work method may be declared for the method of work used in carrying out a task. A task is identified as being either a milestone task or not. A milestone task is defined by the marker _IsMilestone_. and has no duration. A status and priority for each task may also be set.

{ .use-head}
### Time and duration use definition

Compared to previous IFC releases, basic task time information (scheduled start time, scheduled finish time, duration) is now directly attached to _IfcTask_ through the _TaskTime_ attribute. Regular tasks are defined through _IfcTaskTime_. Recurring tasks are defined through _IfcTaskTimeRecurring_. In case a regular task is derived from a recurring task both tasks should be linked together through a _IfcRelNests_ relationship, where _IfcRelNests.IsNestedBy_ points to the recurring task and _IfcRelNests.Nests_ points to all regular tasks that have been derived from the recurring task.

{ .use-head}
### Representation of other activities

The use definitions for _IfcTask_ have been generalised to represent other activities as well, including activities that had been defined by own entities in previous IFC releases. This includes

* Order actions
* Move operations

_IfcTask_ represents an order that might be carried out by a Helpdesk acting the role of interface for the organization between the facility user and the functional requirement of fulfilling their needs. The actual task represented by the _IfcTask_ entity is turning a request into an order and initiating the action that will enable the order to be completed. The _IfcProjectOrder_ or one of its subtypes including maintenance work order, is related to the _IfcTask_ using _IfcRelAssignsToControl_.

_IfcTask_ can also be used to describe an activity that moves people, groups within an organization or complete organizations together with their associated furniture and equipment from one place to another. It thus replaces the previous IFC entity _IfcMove_. The functionality is represented in _IfcTask_ as follows:

* Move from: The place from which actors and their associated equipment are moving. Use _IfcRelAssignsToProcess_ where _RelatingProcess_ points to the task and _RelatedObjects_ holds the location(s) from which to move.
* Move to: The place to which actors and their associated equipment are moving. Use _IfcRelAssignsToProduct_ where _RelatedObjects_ points to the task(s) and _RelatingProduct_ points to the location to which to move.
* Punch list: A list of points concerning a move that require attention. Use _LongDescription_ or else identify sub-tasks to track punch list items individually via _IfcRelNests_.

## Attributes

### Status
Current status of the task.

> NOTE Particular values for status are not specified, these should be determined and agreed by local usage. Examples of possible status values include 'NOTSTARTED', 'STARTED', 'COMPLETED'.

### WorkMethod
The method of work used in carrying out a task.

> NOTE This attribute should not be used if the work method is specified for the _IfcTaskType_

### IsMilestone
Identifies whether a task is a milestone task (= TRUE) or not (= FALSE).

> NOTE In small project planning applications, a milestone task may be understood to be a task having no duration. As such, it represents a singular point in time.

### Priority
A value that indicates the relative priority of the task (in comparison to the priorities of other tasks).

### TaskTime
Time related information for the task.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE Attribute added

### PredefinedType
Identifies the predefined types of a task from which the type required may be set.

{ .change-ifc2x4}

## Formal Propositions

### HasName
The _Name_ attribute should be inserted to describe the task name.

### CorrectPredefinedType
The attribute _ObjectType_ must be asserted when the value of _PredefinedType_ is set to _USERDEFINED_.

## Concepts

### Classification Association

An _IfcTask_ may be assigned a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) code from of a published external structure or company standard. As well as being used to designate the code, the classification structure also enables the source of the work breakdown structure classification to be identified.

### Constraint Association

Constraints may be applied to a task's scheduled duration, start, or finish, by setting the _IfcMetric.ReferencePath_ to the corresponding attribute on the _IfcTaskTime_ entity.

Figure FIXEDDURATION indicates fixed duration of task with _ConstraintGrade=HARD_ and _Benchmark=EQUALTO_ such that changes to an assigned _IfcConstructionResource.Usage.ScheduleWork_ should impact _IfcConstructionResource.Usage.ScheduleUsage_, and vice-versa.

### Control Assignment

Occurrences of _IfcTask_ may be assigned to an _IfcWorkControl_ (either a work plan or a work schedule) through _IfcRelAssignsToControl_. Please note that the _IfcRelAssignsTasks_ relationship class has been removed in IFC4 and is no longer available.

### Object Nesting

_IfcTask_ may be contained within an _IfcTask_ using the _IfcRelNests_ relationship. An _IfcTask_ may in turn nest other _IfcTask_, _IfcProcedure_ or _IfcEvent_ entities. Such nesting indicates decomposed level of detail. From IFC4 onwards it is required to have a summary task (root of all tasks), which is used to define a link to the work plan or work schedule. All subtasks of the summary tasks are then implicitly linked to this work plan or work schedule. Please note that the summary task is used for data organization and not meant to store typical task information as defined by the user. It is therefore recommended that the summary task is hidden from the user to avoid confusion. Please also note that _IfcRelNests_ is used to show the dependency between regular tasks and recurring task definitions (please see the section about time and duration use definitions).

As shown in Figure 1, the installation of a number of items of equipment within a particular space may be the subject of a single task which is identified as 'fix equipment in space 123'. _IfcTask_ represents the occurrence of a work performance of a type of process in a construction plan.

![task example](../../../../figures/ifctask_example.png)

Figure 1 — Task visualization

A task may nest other tasks as sub-items; the nesting relationship is modeled by _IfcRelNests_ as shown in Figure 2. For example, the construction of a stud wall may be designated as a nesting task named 'install wall #1' including other tasks such as 'install dry wall', 'install studs', 'wall taping', and 'erect wall' as sub-processes. A value that indicates the relative tree view position of the task (in comparison to the tree view position of other tasks and the task hierarchy defined by _IfcRelNests_).

The task order information that is used for viewing purposes is derived from the order defined by the _IfcRelNests_ relationship and thus is independent of the logical task order defined through _IfcRelSequence_. The hierarchy and order defined through _IfcRelNests_ enables to order the tasks in a tree view or list view structure.

![task instantiation diagram](../../../../figures/ifctask_instantiation_diagram.png)

Figure 2 — Task nesting relationships

A top-level task is declared within the _IfcProject_ using the _IfcRelDeclares_ relationship.

### Object Typing

The _IfcTask_ defines the anticipated or actual occurrence of any task; common information about task types is handled by _IfcTaskType_.

> EXAMPLE It includes fixed duration, fixed unit or fixed work. An _IfcTask_ can be aggregated to a task type in order to specify a task sequence or any time related information, e.g. the duration of a task. Please see the documentation of _IfcTaskType_ for further information.

### Process Assignment

It is suggested to use the 'summary task' (root element of the task hierarchy that is required for task management purposes) to assign all subtask to a work plan or work schedule. Resources used by tasks are assigned by _IfcRelAssignsToProcess_.

### Product Assignment



### Property Sets for Objects



### Sequential Connectivity

The relationship _IfcRelSequence_ is used to indicate control flow. An _IfcTask_ as a successor to an _IfcTask_ indicates logical sequence how these tasks should be performed. _IfcTask_ entities can be triggered or can trigger _IfcEvent_ entities, which is also defined through the relationship _IfcRelSequence_.

An _IfcTaskType_ provides for all forms of types of task that may be specified. It is a reference definition for a unit of work that may be broken down into (a sequence of) subtasks. Please note that a reference definition can not be part of a workflow definition, i.e. _IfcTaskType_ instances define the most abstract level of a reference process without dependencies to other reference processes.

Usage of _IfcTaskType_ defines the parameters for one or more occurrences of _IfcTask_. Parameters may be specified through property sets that may be enumerated in the _IfcTaskTypeEnum_ data type or through explicit attributes of _IfcTaskType_. Task occurrences (_IfcTask_ entities) are linked to the task type through the _IfcRelDefinesByType_ relationship.

Figure 1 shows the definition of a task type that is part of a task template library. Please note that in this example the task type is further subdivided into tasks that define task times (for example, duration) and/or a task sequence.

## Attributes

### PredefinedType
Identifies the predefined types of a task type from which the type required may be set.

### WorkMethod
The method of work used in carrying out a task.

## Formal Propositions

### CorrectPredefinedType
The attribute _ProcessType_ must be asserted when the value of _PredefinedType_ is set to _USERDEFINED_.

## Concepts

### Object Nesting

_IfcTaskType_ may nest other _IfcTaskType_ or _IfcTask_ entities using the _IfcRelNests_ relationship. Such nesting indicates decomposed level of detail. Nesting of _IfcTask_ entities is used if a task type shall be detailed by a sequence of tasks or if there is a need to include additional time information such as the duration of subtasks. Please note that _IfcTask_ entities being contained within an _IfcTaskType_ are linked with their task occurrences via _IfcRelDefinesByObject_ relationships. It is also possible to define a task type for these _IfcTask_ entities via _IfcRelDefinesByType_ relationships. For further information please see the documentation of _IfcRelDefinesByObject_.

# IfcWorkCalendar

An _IfcWorkCalendar_ defines working and non-working time periods for tasks and resources. It enables to define both specific time periods, such as from 7:00 till 12:00 on 25th August 2009, as well as repetitive time periods based on frequently used recurrence patterns, such as each Monday from 7:00 till 12:00 between 1st March 2009 and 31st December 2009.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> HISTORY New entity in IFC4.

A work calendar is a subtype of _IfcControl_ and thus inherits the feature for controlling other objects through _IfcRelAssignsToControl_, which is used to define a work calendar for tasks (_IfcTask_) and resources (_IfcResource_). It also inherits a name and description attribute, whereas a name shall be given and a description may be given as an indication of its content and usage.

The definition of time periods can be derived from a base calendar and/or modified/defined by a set of working times and non-working exception times. All time periods defined by _IfcWorkCalendar.ExceptionTimes_ override the time periods inherited from the base calendar (base calendar is defined as the next applicable calendar for the task or resource). Thus, exception times replace the working times from the base calendar.

Figure 1 shows the definition of a work calendar, which is defined by a set of work times and exception times. The work times are defined as recurring patterns with optional boundaries (applying from and/or to a specific date). The shown example defines a simple work calendar with working times Monday to Thursday 8:00 to 12:00 and 13:00 to 17:00, Friday 8:00 to 14:00 and as exception every 1st Monday in a month the work starts one hour later - i.e. the working time on every 1st Monday in a month is overridden to be 9:00 to 12:00 and 13:00 to 17:00. Both the working time and the exception time is valid for the period of 01.09.2010 till 30.08.2011.

## Attributes

### WorkingTimes
Set of times periods that are regarded as an initial set-up of working times. Exception times can then further restrict these working times.

### ExceptionTimes
Set of times periods that define exceptions (non-working times) for the given working times including the base calendar, if provided.

### PredefinedType
Identifies the predefined types of a work calendar from which the type required may be set.

### Control Assignment

The base calendar of a work calendar is defined by _IfcRelAssignsToControl_, where _IfcRelAssignsToControl.RelatingControl_ is linked with the base calendar and _IfcRelAssignsToControl.RelatedObjects_ is linked with work calendars that are derived from the base calendar. Although not restricted by the _IfcRelAssignsToControl_ relationship it is only allowed to have one base calendar.

A work control may have resources assigned to it. This is handled by the _IfcRelAssignsToControl_ relationship. A work control should also define a context that gives further information about its usage. If no special context information is required then the _IfcProject_ instance as a global context should be used instead. An explicit link between the work control and the _IfcProject_ via _IfcRelDeclares_ should then be provided.

The attribute _IfcWorkControl.Purpose_ is used to define the purpose of either a work schedule or a work plan. In the case of _IfcWorkPlan_, the purpose attribute can be used to determine if the work plan is for cost estimating, task scheduling or some other defined purpose.

From IFC4 onwards the assignment of tasks to the work control is handled by the IfcRelAssignsToControl relationship. IfcRelAssignsTasks as used in previous IFC releases has been deleted and can not be used any longer. Another change in IFC4 is that it is not necessary to assign each task to a work control as it is regarded to be sufficient if the summary task (root task in the task hierarchy defined through IfcRelNests relationships) is assigned to a work control.

IfcProcessExtension
===================

The _IfcProcessExtension_ schema provides the primary information that expands one of the key ideas of the IFC Model. This is the idea of 'process' which captures ideas about the mapping of processes in a logical sequence or planning and scheduling of work and the tasks required for its completion. It is important to understand that process information can be expressed by classes in exactly the same way as product information.

The _IfcProcessExtension_ schema extends the primary idea of the _IfcProcess_ outlined in the _IfcKernel_ schema. The objective of the _IfcProcessExtension_ schema is to capture information that supports the mapping of processes and the planning and scheduling of work and the procedures and resources required to carry out work. The aim is to provide support for information exchange and sharing within commonly used process mapping and scheduling applications; the extent of the model will not support the more detailed ideas found in more specialized applications.

The following are within the scope of this part of the specifications:

* definition of work plans including the tasks that are included within the plan and identification of the resources required by the plan,
* definition of work schedules together with the elements that make up the schedule, the time constraints and durations applicable to the elements,
* identification of work tasks and task types included in plans and schedules,
* identification of procedures and procedure types that identify procedural steps required in response to an event,
* identification of events and event types that identify points in a process at which a particular response is required,
* identification of the relationship between a process and the resources that are consumed by the process,
* allocation of resources to work plans, work schedules and work tasks.

# IfcAlignment

For the purposes of IFC the English term "alignment" defines three separate but closely interconnected concepts.
<!-- end of short definition -->

1. definition of a reference system for linear positioning
2. safeguarding and optimization of the movement of vehicles - kinematic perspective
3. geometric construction of roads, railway tracks or other linear infrastructure

**Reference system for linear positioning**

An alignment is used to define a reference system to position elements mainly for linear construction works, such as roads, rails, bridges, and others. The relative positioning along the alignment is defined by the linear referencing methodology.

> NOTE See ISO 19148 Geographic information – Linear referencing for general definitions about linear referencing.

**Kinematic perspective**

In the kinematic perspective, the focus is on the safe and optimized movement of a vehicle under the constraints induced by changes in the direction of the horizontal and the vertical layout.

**Geometric perspective**

In the geometric perspective the focus is on the proper placement of horizontal and vertical segments to connect certain points along a proposed path. A huge body of knowledge has been developed over a long period of time, in many aspects predating the availability of modern computers and their software.

Supported shape representations of _IfcAlignment_ are:

* _IfcCompositeCurve_ as a 2D horizontal alignment (represented by its horizontal alignment segments), without a vertical layout.
* _IfcGradientCurve_ as a 3D horizontal and vertical alignment (represented by their alignment segments), without a cant layout.
* _IfcSegmentedReferenceCurve_ as a 3D curve defined relative to an _IfcGradientCurve_ to incorporate the application of cant.
* _IfcOffsetCurveByDistances_ as a 2D or 3D curve defined relative to an _IfcGradientCurve_ or another _IfcOffsetCurveByDistances_.
* _IfcPolyline_ or _IfcIndexedPolyCurve_ as a 3D alignment by a 3D polyline representation (such as coming from a survey).
* _IfcPolyline_ or _IfcIndexedPolyCurve_ as a 2D horizontal alignment by a 2D polyline representation (such as in very early planning phases or as a map representation).

**State of the art in contemporary engineering**
Generally, contemporary engineering follows these steps when defining an alignment.

1. First, a horizontal layout in a properly projected plane is established.

2. In a second step, the vertical layout (i.e. sequence of segments with constant gradients, together with smoothing segments showing a variation in gradient) is added.

3. In the rail domain, in most cases a cant layout is added to the horizontal layout to compensate a part of the unwanted lateral acceleration.

4. In a final step, the proposed layout is checked against a defined set of rules, formulas and thresholds to guarantee the conformance against the regulation.

The sequence of steps might change from case to case and might be repeated one or more times to achieve the economic objectives and fulfill regulatory safety requirements.

Contemporary alignment design almost always implements a 2.5 dimension approach. The resulting and documented geometry might be very precise or just good enough to meet safety thresholds. This depends on factors like priorities of the management, date of the design - existing alignments might have been designed more then 50 years ago - or software tools used. Working with legacy data in a high precision BIM model requires a good understanding of these factors.

**Distinction between business logic and geometry definition**

The alignment concept is organised into two parts. These two parts work together, but they can also be used and exchanged independently.

1. *Business logic* of alignment
2. *Geometry definition* of alignment

**Business logic:** the IFC schema allows to describe an alignment using terminology and concepts that are as close as possible to business ones. It allows to describe the layouts that make up the alignment (i.e. horizontal, vertical, cant), their segments' structure and attributes. Also, the *business logic* part provides the anchor point for domain specific properties, such as design speed or cant deficiency.

**Geometry definition:** the IFC schema provides well established IFC geometric entities to represent the business concepts. 

A mapping between the *business logic* and its *geometry definition* in IFC is described by the concept templates related to the alignment geometry.


## Attributes

### PredefinedType

## Concepts

### Alignment Aggregation To Project

* Every _IfcAlignment_ must be related to _IfcProject_ using the _IfcRelAggregates_ relationship - either directly or indirectly. The indirect case is when a child alignment is aggregated to a parent alignment. In this case, only the parent alignment must be related to _IfcProject_.
* Instances of _IfcAlignment_ must not be related to spatial elements using _IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure_.

### Alignment Layouts

A single alignment may be described by one or more of the following layouts:

* a horizontal layout (_IfcAlignmentHorizontal_), defined in the x/y plane of the engineering coordinate system.
* an accompanying vertical layout (_IfcAlignmentVertical_), defined along the horizontal layout in the distance along / z coordinate space.
* an accompanying cant layout (_IfcAlignmentCant_), defined as lateral inclination along the horizontal layout.

These 3 layouts may be used in different configurations. The most common are:

1. Only Horizontal (H) layout
2. Horizontal and Vertical (V) layouts
3. Horizontal, Vertical and Cant (C) layouts
4. Multiple Vertical layouts based on the same Horizontal Layout
5. Multiple Vertical layouts based on the same Horizontal Layout, with a Cant layout applied

(4) and (5) are used in scenarios where multiple alignments re-use the same horizontal layout definition. See **Alignment Layout - Reusing Horizontal Layout** and **Alignment Geometry - Reusing Horizontal Layout** for details on how to relate parent and child alignments in these cases.

For configuration (1)

### Alignment Geometry - Horizontal and Vertical

For configuration (2)

### Alignment Geometry - Horizontal, Vertical and Cant

### Element Decomposition

In scenarios where multiple alignments re-use the same horizontal layout definition, these alignment can be aggregated in a parent-child relationship, to avoid redefining the horizontal layout. This is done using _IfcRelAggregates_.

If the parent alignment has a *geometry definition* for its horizontal layout, then all the children can use this definition as *BaseCurve* to construct their own representations.

### Alignment Geometry - Reusing Horizontal Layout

For configurations (4),(5)

### Alignment Geometry - Segments

### Alignment Spatial Reference

Alignments can be related to a spatial element using _IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure_.

### Alignment Grouping

Alignments may be assigned to groups using _IfcRelAssignsToGroup_, where _IfcGroup_ or subtypes may capture information common to multiple alignments.

### Object Nesting

Alignments can nest _IfcReferent_'s, such as stations or mileage points. These can be used as semantic entities holding information about locations along the alignment curve. This is done using the _IfcRelNests_ relationship.

# IfcAlignmentCant

An _IfcAlignmentCant_ is a lateral inclination profile defined along the horizontal alignment. All points defined in this profile have two coordinate values. The first value is the distance along the horizontal alignment, and the second value is the height relative to the projection of the point along vertical alignment.
<!-- end of short definition -->

**Cant as a railway specificity**

![Why cant is applied](../../../../figures/ifcalignmentcant_wojtczak_2018.png "Figure 1 — Cant - compensation for lateral acceleration.")

> NOTE Figure 1 was first published in _(Basics of) Railway Curve Kinematics Presentation_, (Wojtczak 2018)

The diagram in the figure above shows the principle of compensating part of the lateral acceleration by elevating the outer rail relative to the inner rail of a track.

Almost always the following principles for the placement of horizontal segments and cant segments are implemented:

* Straight horizontal line: no applied cant
* Horizontal circular arc: constant applied cant
* Horizontal transition bend: variation of applied cant according to a defined formula

In specific difficult topographic environments like mountain lines the extension of a cant transition may differ from the horizontal transition. So far this has only been found for clothoids and is either a so called shortened ramp (cant transition is shorter than the corresponding horizontal curvature transition) or a so called “scissor” ramp (overlapping variations of cant on both rails with opposite direction).

Application of high-performance horizontal transition bends is always combined with a cant transition with identical start and end location.

In real world designs, such as slow speed sections in railway stations, exceptions to the above principles can be found. It might even happen that the inner rail is elevated relative to the outer rail.

Detailed geometric modelling of the superelevation has a low priority in the existing processes in most rail companies. This will very probably change with the introduction of 3D modelling in rail design. The following list shows some use cases:

* Correct 3D placement of certain assets (e.g. sleepers)
* Relevant input for calculation of structural gauge space
* Correct calculation of horizontal coordinate values for the Viennese Bend® (high performance transition bend)

# IfcAlignmentVertical

An _IfcAlignmentVertical_ is a height profile along the horizontal alignment. Points along a vertical alignment have two coordinate values. The first value is the distance along the horizontal alignment, the second value is the height according to the project engineering coordinate system. Based on the context of the project, they are georeferenced and the height value is convertible into orthogonal height above/below the vertical datum.

# IfcAnnotation

An annotation is an information element within the geometric (and spatial) context of a project, that adds a note or meaning to the objects which constitutes the project model. Annotations include additional points, curves, text, dimensioning, hatching and other forms of graphical notes. It also includes virtual or symbolic representations of additional model components, not representing products or spatial structures, such as survey points and lines, contour lines or similar.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> NOTE Additional presentation information (often 2D) such as tag number or hatching, that is directly related to a particular product representation is included within the _IfcProductDefinitionShape_ having various _IfcShapeRepresentation_'s of the _IfcElement_ (and its subtypes). Only those presentation information, that cannot be directly related to a single product, have to be wrapped within the _IfcAnnotation_.

If available, the annotation should be related to the spatial context of the project, by containing the annotation within the appropriate level of the building structure (site, facility, facility part or building, storey, or space). This is handled by the _IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure_ relationship.

The predefined type values in _IfcAnnotationTypeEnum_ suggest some of the type of annotations that can be used.

# IfcBuilding

A building represents a structure that provides shelter for its occupants or contents and stands in one place. The building is also used to provide a basic element within the spatial structure hierarchy for the components of a building project (together with site, storey, and space).
<!-- end of short definition -->

> NOTE Definition from ISO 6707-1:
> Construction work that has the provision of shelter for its occupants or contents as one of its main purpose and is normally designed to stand permanently in one place.

A building is (if specified) associated to a site. A building may span over several connected or disconnected buildings. Therefore building complex provides for a collection of buildings included in a site. A building can also be decomposed in parts, where each part defines a building section. This is defined by the composition type attribute of the supertype _IfcSpatialStructureElement_ which is interpreted as follow:

* **COMPLEX**: building complex
* **ELEMENT**: building
* **PARTIAL**: building section

The _IfcBuilding_ is used to build the spatial structure of a building (that serves as the primary project breakdown and is required to be hierarchical). The spatial structure elements are linked together by using the objectified relationship _IfcRelAggregates_. Figure 1 shows the _IfcBuilding_ as part of the spatial structure. It also serves as the spatial container for building and other elements.

> NOTE Detailed requirements on mandatory element containment and placement structure relationships are given in model view definitions.

Systems, such as building service or electrical distribution systems, zonal systems, or structural analysis systems, relate to _IfcBuilding_ by using the objectified relationship _IfcRelServicesBuildings_.

Figure 2 describes the heights and elevations of the _IfcBuilding_. It is used to provide the height above sea level of the project height datum for this building, that is, the internal height 0.00. The height 0.00 is often used as a building internal reference height and equal to the floor finish level of the ground floor.

The building storey has an elevation and typically represents a (nearly) horizontal aggregation of spaces that are vertically bound.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> NOTE Definition from ISO 6707-1:
> space between two consecutive floors or between a floor and a roof

A storey is (if specified) associated to a building. A storey may span over several connected storeys. Therefore storey complex provides for a collection of storeys included in a building. A storey can also be decomposed in (horizontal) parts, where each part defines a partial storey. This is defined by the composition type attribute of the supertype _IfcSpatialStructureElement_ which is interpreted as follow:

* **COMPLEX**: building storey complex
* **ELEMENT**: building storey
* **PARTIAL**: partial building storey

> EXAMPLE In split level houses, a storey is split into two or more partial storeys, each with a different elevation. It can be handled by defining a storey, which includes two or more partial storeys with the individual elevations.

The _IfcBuildingStorey_ is used to build the spatial structure of a building (that serves as the primary project breakdown and is required to be hierarchical). The spatial structure elements are linked together by using the objectified relationship _IfcRelAggregates_.

The _IfcDistributionElementType_ is attached using the _IfcRelDefinesByType.RelatingType_ objectified relationship and is accessible by the inverse _IsDefinedBy_ attribute.

The assignment of types to distribution element occurrences is vital for providing the additional meaning, or ontology, of the distribution element. Many specialized type are defined in other schemas of this specification.

# IfcDistributionElementType

The _IfcDistributionElementType_ defines a list of commonly shared property set definitions of an element and an optional set of product representations. It is used to define an element specification (i.e. the specific product information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type).
<!-- end of short definition -->

> NOTE The product representations are defined as representation maps (at the level of the supertype _IfcTypeProduct_, which gets assigned by an element occurrence instance through the _IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]_ being an _IfcMappedItem_.

A distribution element type is used to define the common properties of a certain type of a distribution element that may be applied to many instances of that feature type to assign a specific style. Distribution element types (or the instantiable subtypes) may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.

The occurrences of the _IfcDistributionElementType_ are represented by instances of _IfcDistributionElement_ (or its subtypes).

# IfcElement

An element is a generalization of all components that make up a facility.
<!-- end of short definition -->

Elements are physically existent objects, although they might be void elements, such as holes. Elements either remain permanently in the facility, or only temporarily, as formwork does. Elements can be either assembled on site or pre-manufactured and built in on site.

> EXAMPLE Examples of elements in a building construction context are walls, floors, windows and recesses.

The elements can be logically contained by a spatial structure element that constitutes a certain level within a project structure hierarchy (site, building, storey or space). This is done by using the _IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure_ relationship. An element can have material and quantity information assigned through the _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_ and _IfcRelDefinesByProperties_ relationship.

In addition an element can be declared to be a specific occurrence of an element type (and thereby be defined by the element type properties) using the _IfcRelDefinesByType_ relationship. An element can also be defined as an element assembly that is a group of semantically and topologically related elements that form a higher level part of the facility. Those element assemblies are defined by virtue of the _IfcRelAggregates_ relationship.

> EXAMPLE Examples for element assembly are complete Roof Structures, made by several Roof Areas, or a Stair, composed by Flights and Landings.

Elements that perform the same function may be grouped by an "Element Group By Function". It is realized by an instance of _IfcGroup_ with the _ObjectType_ ='ElementGroupByFunction'.

# IfcElementQuantity

An _IfcElementQuantity_ defines a set of derived measures of an element's physical property. Elements could be spatial structure elements (like buildings, storeys, or spaces) or building elements (like walls, slabs, finishes). The _IfcElementQuantity_ gets assigned to the element by using the _IfcRelDefinesByProperties_ relationship.
<!-- end of short definition -->

The optional _MethodOfMeasurement_ attribute defines the code, e.g. from a standard method of measurement, which had been used to calculate the element quantity.

> NOTE The recognizable values for the name and the method of measurement attributes have to be agreed upon in further agreement documents, such as implementers agreements. Some of these agreements might be limited to a certain region, to which the method of measurement applies.

The name attribute, given at the individual _Quantities_ provides a recognizable semantic meaning of the element quantity. Both information is needed to establish a precise meaning for the measure value. An optional description may be assigned to each of the _Quantities_. All quantities assigned by a single instance of _IfcElementQuantity_ are deemed to have been generated according to the same method of measurement. However several instances of _IfcElementQuantity_ are assignable to an element, thus allowing for an element having quantities generated according to several methods of measurement.

> EXAMPLE To exchange the net floor area of spaces in the German region (as _IfcSpace_), the name might be 'Netto-Grundfläche' (net floor area), and the method of measurement might be accordingly 'DIN277-2' (German industry norm no. 277 edition 2).

> EXAMPLE The same instance of _IfcSpace_ may have a different area measure assigned in the German region according to a housing regulation, the name would be 'Wohnfläche' and the method of measurement would be '2.BV'. It would be attached to the _IfcSpace_ by a separate _IfcRelDefinesByProperties_ relationship.

The _IfcElementQuantity_ can have the following subtypes of _IfcPhysicalQuantity_ within its SET of _Quantities_, which count for the basis measure types used:

* count measure
* weight measure
* length measure
* area measure
* volume measure
* time measure

Base quantities are quantity definitions that are independent of a particular method of measurement and therefore internationally applicable. Base quantities are defined as gross and net values and provided by measurement of the correct geometric shape representation of the element. This specification includes a set of base quantity definition. See each subtype of _IfcElement_ for applicable base quantities.

The following general agreements apply for each base quantity set

* _IfcElementQuantity.Name_ = <name of the qto definition template>
* _IfcElementQuantity.MethodOfMeasurement_ = 'BaseQuantities'
* _IfcElementQuantity.Quantities_ = SET of subtypes of _IfcPhysicalSimpleQuantity_ with values for the _Name_ attribute as published as part of this specification.

# IfcFeatureElementSubtraction

The _IfcFeatureElementSubtraction_ is specialization of the general feature element, that represents an existence dependent element which modifies the shape and appearance of the associated master element. The _IfcFeatureElementSubtraction_ offers the ability to handle shape modifiers as semantic objects within the IFC object model that subtract from the shape of the master element.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> NOTE A single subtraction feature such as the subtype _IfcOpeningElement_ is assigned by a single subtraction relationship _IfcRelVoidsElement_ to one occurrence of _IfcElement_. It establishes a 1:1 relationship between the opening and the element. An element may have several _IfcRelVoidsElement_ relationships, enabling several voids.

The voiding relationship between a master element and a subtraction feature is geometrically resolved by a Boolean difference operation.

The local placement for _IfcFeatureElementSubtraction_ is defined in its supertype _IfcProduct_. It is defined by the _IfcLocalPlacement_, which defines the local coordinate system that is referenced by all geometric representations. The local placement is always defined in relation to the local placement of the building element from which the feature element substraction is substracted:

* The _PlacementRelTo_ attribute of _IfcObjectPlacement_ shall point (if given) to the object placement of the _IfcElement_, which is used in the _VoidsElements.RelatingElement_ inverse attribute (the parent element of the feature).

### HasNoSubtraction
A feature subtraction (e.g. an opening element) can not have other openings to void itself. The inverse relationship _HasOpenings_ shall therefore be NIL.

### IsNotFilling
A feature subtraction (e.g. an opening element) can not be a filling of another void. The inverse relationship _FillsVoids_ shall therefore be NIL.

# IfcGeographicElementType

An _IfcGeographicElementType_ is used to define an element specification of a geographic element (i.e. the specific product information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type). Geographic element types include for different types of element that may be used to represent information within a geographical landscape external to a building. Within the world of geographic information they are referred to generally as 'features'. _IfcGeographicElementType_'s include:

* point features such as seating, bus shelters, signage, trees;
* linear features such as layby's;
* area features such as ponds, lakes, woods and forests;
* drainage such as catchment, reserver or outfall.
<!-- end of short definition -->

The specification of the specific types are given by the inherited attribute _IfcElementType.ElementType_ given as an _IfcLabel_.

Geographic element types are frequently identified in feature catalogs that are produced for particular purposes. The _IfcGeographicElementType_ entity enables the continued use of existing feature catalogs through capture of their identity and attributes.

Information from feature catalogs might be captured in various ways:

* via property sets, some of which will be specifically defined within the IFC property set catalog whilst others will be created for local use; this is the form of capture that is expected to be most widely used
* through use of the IFC classification model whereby features might be identified through an _IfcClassificationReference_ with additional description; in which case, any further attributes required would still need to be captured in property sets.

> NOTE This is due to the range of choices of element type that are available and their expression in different languages. It is not considered possible to create a reasonably full list of types within an enumeration. It is suggested that selection of the relevant type be drawn from an available 'feature catalog'.

# IfcGrid

_IfcGrid_ ia a planar design grid defined in 3D space used as an aid in locating structural and design elements. The position of the grid (_ObjectPlacement_) is defined by a 3D coordinate system (and thereby the design grid can be used in plan, section or in any position relative to the world coordinate system). The position can be relative to the object placement of other products or grids. The XY plane of the 3D coordinate system is used to place the grid axes, which are 2D curves (for example, line, circle, arc, polyline).
<!-- end of short definition -->

The inherited attributes _Name_ and _Description_ can be used to define a descriptive name of the grid and to indicate the grid's purpose. A grid is defined by (normally) two, or (in case of a triangular grid) three lists of grid axes. The following figures show some examples.

A grid may support a rectangular layout as shown in Figure 1, a radial layout as shown in Figure 2, or a triangular layout as shown in Figure 3.

> NOTE The _PredefinedType_ denotes the type of grid that is represented by _IfcGrid_. The instantiation of _IfcGridAxis_ entities has to agree to the _PredefinedType_, if provided.

# IfcOpeningElement

The opening element stands for opening, recess or chase, all reflecting voids. It represents a void within any element that has physical manifestation. Openings can be inserted into walls, slabs, beams, columns, or other elements.
<!-- end of short definition -->

There are two different types of opening elements. The attribute _PredefinedType_ should be used to capture the differences:

* an opening, where the thickness of the opening is greater or equal to the thickness of the element —
 the attribute _PredefinedType_ is set to _OPENING_
* a recess or niche, where the thickness of the recess is smaller than the thickness of the element —
 the attribute _PredefinedType_ is set to _RECESS_ for a recess or niche.

If the value for _PredefinedType_ is omitted, or the value is set to _NOTDEFINED_, no specific information of whether it is an opening or recess shall be assumed.

An _IfcOpeningElement_ has to be inserted into an _IfcElement_ by using the _IfcRelVoidsElement_ relationship. It may be filled by an _IfcDoor_, _IfcWindow_, or another filling element by using the relationship _IfcRelFillsElement_. Depending on the type of the _IfcShapeRepresentation_ of the _IfcOpeningElement_ the voiding relationship implies:

* if the _IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationIdentifier_ = 'Body', then the Body shape representation of the opening has to be subtracted from the body shape representation of the voided element - implicit Boolean difference operation.
* if the _IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationIdentifier_ = 'Reference', then the Reference shape representation of the opening is not subtracted. It is provided in addition to the hole in the Body shape representation of the voided element.

The _IfcOpeningElement_ shall not participate in the containment relationship, i.e. it is not linked directly to the spatial structure of the project. It has a mandatory _VoidsElements_ inverse relationship pointing to the _IfcElement_ that is contained in the spatial structure. The inverse relationship _ContainedInStructure_ shall be NIL.

* _IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationIdentifier_: 'Body'
* _IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationType_: 'SweptSolid'

The following constraints are recommended:

* _IfcShapeRepresentation.Items_ may include a single, or multiple, instances of _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_.
* _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid.SweptArea_ shall support _IfcRectangleProfileDef_, _IfcCircleProfileDef_ and _IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef_.
* If multiple instances of _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_ are used, the extrusion direction of each extrusion should be equal.

If parametric profiles are used, the parameters may be interpreted to be the dimensions of the opening:

* _IfcRectangleProfileDef.YDim_ interpreted as opening height
* _IfcRectangleProfileDef.XDim_ interpreted as opening width

There are two main extrusion directions: perpendicular and parallel.

**Perpendicular Swept Solid Representation Type**

For a perpendicular swept solid, _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid.ExtrudedDirection_ shall extrude the profile perpendicular to the element it is voiding. This may be horizontal for wall openings, or vertical for floor openings.

![standard opening](../../../../figures/ifcopeningelement_horizontal-layout1.png "Figure FULLEXTRUSION — Opening with full extrusion")

![recess](../../../../figures/ifcopeningelement_recess-layout1.png "Figure RECESS — Opening with recess extrusion")

> NOTE The local placement directions for the _IfcOpeningElement_ in Figure FULLEXTRUSION and Figure RECESS are only given as an example; other directions are valid as well.

> NOTE Rectangles are now defined centrally, so the placement location has to be set to _IfcCartesianPoint_(XDim/2,YDim/2)

**Parallel Swept Solid Representation Type**

For a parallel swept solid,_IfcExtrudedAreaSolid.ExtrudedDirection_ shall extrude the profile parallel to the element it is voiding. This may be vertical in the case of walls.

Parallel extrusions shall be used when an opening or recess has a non rectangular foot print geometry that does not change along the height of the opening or recess.

Figure VERTEXTRUDE shows a vertical extrusion with multiple extrusion bodies for the opening. Each extrusion body has a different extrusion length.

### Product Local Placement

The local placement for _IfcOpeningElement_ is defined in its supertype _IfcProduct_. It is defined by the _IfcLocalPlacement_, which defines the local coordinate system that is referenced by all geometric representations.

* The _PlacementRelTo_ relationship of _IfcLocalPlacement_ should point to the local placement of the element which is voided by the opening, i.e. referred to by _VoidsElement.RelatingBuildingElement_.

### Reference Geometry

Since there are no Boolean operations, either as _IfcBooleanResult_ or implicitly by _IfcRelVoidsElement_, the geometry of the _IfcOpeningElement_ shall not be used to subtract the opening from the 'Body' shape representation of the voided element.

Since there are no Boolean operations, either as _IfcBooleanResult_ or implicitly by _IfcRelVoidsElement_, the geometry of the _IfcOpeningElement_ shall not be used to subtract the opening from the 'Body' shape representation of the voided element.

The relationship is defined to be a 1 to many relationship. The _IfcRelAdheresToElement_ establishes an aggregation relationship between the main element and a sub ordinary surface feature.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> NOTE In contrary the _IfcRelAggregates_ relationship establishes an aggregation of equal parts to a whole.

The _IfcRelAdheresToElement_ implies a surface interface between the geometric bodies of the element and the surface feature . As with all decomposition relationships it determines:

* existence dependency - the _RelatedSurfaceFeature_ cannot exist without the _RelatingElement_
* hierarchical and non-cyclical relationship - the _IfcRelAdheresToElement_ can only alter a single _IfcElement_
* no spatial containment - the _IfcSurfaceFeature_ as related element never participates in the hierarchical spatial containment relationship _IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure_

# IfcRelAssociatesMaterial

_IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_ is an objectified relationship between a material definition and elements or element types to which this material definition applies.
<!-- end of short definition -->

The material definition can be:

* assigned to an element occurrence as a specific usage of a layer set or profile set
* assigned to an element occurrence or element type as a layer set, profile set, constituent set or a single material

Materials can be arranged by layers and applied to layered elements. Typical elements are walls and slabs.

* An _IfcMaterialLayerSet_, for layered elements with an indication of the layering direction and individual layer thicknesses
* An _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_, i.e. a material layer set with positioning information along the reference axis or surface of the element.

>> NOTE As a material layer set usage is an occurrence based information, that applies to each individual element, it cannot be assigned to an element type.

Material can be applied to profiles. Typical elements using profile material are beam, column, member

* An _IfcMaterialProfileSet_, i.e. a set of material assigned to a set of profiles, with a single material assigned to a single profile as the default.
* An _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_, i.e. a material profile set with positioning information relative to the element axis, also referred to as cardinal point.

>> NOTE As a material profile set usage is an occurrence based information, that applies to each individual element, it cannot be assigned to an element type.

Materials can be arranged by identified parts of a component based element. Typical elements are doors/windows (with components such as lining, framing and glazing), or distribution elements.

* An _IfcMaterialConstituentSet_, for component based elements with an indication of the component by keyword to which the material constituent applies.

>> NOTE See the material use definitions at each applicable subtype of _IfcElement_ or _IfcElementType_ for a provision of these keywords.

As a fallback, or in cases where only a single material information is needed, material information can be directly associated

* A single _IfcMaterial_ for any element where the material use definition does not prohibit its direct association
* An _IfcMaterialList_, e.g. for composite elements, without any information on how the different materials are arranged.

>> IFC4 DEPRECATION The use of _IfcMaterialList_ is deprecated in IFC4 onwards. Use _IfcMaterialConstituentSet_ instead.

The _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_ relationship is a special type of the _IfcRelAssociates_ relationship. It can be applied to subtypes of _IfcElement_ and subtypes of _IfcElementType_.

* The _IfcElement_ has an inverse relation to its material definition by the _HasAssociations_ attribute, inherited from _IfcObject_.
* The _IfcElementType_ has an inverse relation to its material definition by the _HasAssociations_ attribute, inherited from _IfcObjectDefinition_.

If both, the element occurrence (by an instance of _IfcElement_) and the element type (by an instance of _IfcElementType_, connected through _IfcRelDefinesByType_) have an associated material, then the material associated to the element occurrence overrides the material associated to the element type.

An _IfcRelConnectsWithRealizingElements_ is a specialization of _IfcRelConnectsElements_ where the connecting operation has the additional attribute of (one or many) realizing elements that may be used to realize or further qualify the relationship. It is defined as a ternary relationship.

> EXAMPLE It may be used to describe the attachment of one element to another where the attachment is realized by a 'fixing' element such as a bracket. It may also be used to describe the mounting of one element onto another such as the requirement for the mounting major plant items onto builders work bases and/or anti-vibration isolators.

> NOTE Regarding bridge prestressing, the tendon conduits and the tendon anchors are aggregated into the concrete elements, but not always the tendon itself (as the tendon may pass through several elements). Therefore, it is good practise to use RelConnects relationships between the tendon and the tendon conduits and the tendon anchors.

The connection types for bridges include:

* TrussJoint: Joint between truss members.
* ExpansionJoint: Joint allowing movement, usually due to thermal expansion difference in structures, with DiscreteAccessory of type EXPANSION_JOINT_DEVICE as RealizingElement.
* EmbeddedPartsJoint: Joint for auxiliary parts to structure, with appropriate RealizingElements, such as DiscreteAccessories of type ANCHORPLATE, BRACKET or SHOE.

# IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure

This objectified relationship, _IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure_, is used to assign elements to a certain level of the spatial project structure. Any element can only be assigned once to a certain level of the spatial structure. The question, which level is relevant for which type of element, can only be answered within the context of a particular project and might vary within the various regions.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> EXAMPLE A multi-storey space is contained (or belongs to) the building storey at which its ground level is, but it is referenced by all the other building storeys, in which it spans. A lift shaft might be contained by the basement, but referenced by all storeys, through which it spans.

The containment relationship of an element within a spatial structure has to be a hierarchical relationship; an element can only be contained within a single spatial structure element. The reference relationship between an element and the spatial structure need not be hierarchical; that is, an element can reference many spatial structure elements.

> NOTE The reference relationship is expressed by _IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure_.

Occurrences of the same element type can be assigned to different spatial structure elements depending on the context of the occurrence.

> EXAMPLE A wall might be normally assigned to a storey, however the curtain wall might be assigned to the building and the retaining wall in the terrain might be assigned to the site.

Figure 1 shows the use of _IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure_ to assign a stair and two walls to two different levels within the spatial structure.

# IfcRelInterferesElements

The _IfcRelInterferesElements_ objectified relationship indicates that two elements interfere.
<!-- end of short definition -->

It is a 1 to 1 relationship, and the concept of two elements interfering physically or logically is described independently of the elements.

The interference may be related to the shape representation of the entities by providing an interference geometry or zone:

* when the interference is between two physical products, the _InterferenceGeometry_ attribute is used to define the physical interference shape, it can be part of the shape of one of the elements used in the relationship or define the interface between the two shapes using a _IfcConnectionGeometry_.
* when the interference is between two spatial objects, the _InterferenceSpace_ attribute is used to define the interference space between the two footprints associated to the spatial objects, expressed by a specific _IfcSpatialZone_ of predefined type _IfcSpatialZoneTypeEnum_ INTERFERENCE.

If the interference geometry and Zone are omitted then the interference is provided as a logical relationship. Under this circumstance, the connection point, curve, surface, or solid has to be recalculated by the receiving application.

The _RelatingElement_ and _RelatedElement_ define the two elements in the relationship, that may have different roles.
The relation orientation may be required by certain _InterferenceType_ values or _InterferenceGeometry_ calculation, this is done by setting the attribute _ImpliedOrder_ accordingly:

* _ImpliedOrder_=TRUE The _RelatingElement_ constitutes the primary element of the interference relationship that is oriented from _RelatingElement_ (source) to _RelatedElement_ (target). If the interference is to be resolved by subtracting the overlapping part, it should be subtracted from the _RelatingElement_. The net result would be the _RelatingElement_ subtracted by the _InterferenceGeometry_. This would be the case in interference relationships where the _RelatedElement_ creates a void in the _RelatingElement_ dynamically.
* _ImpliedOrder_=FALSE The _RelatingElement_ and _RelatedElement_ have no priority among each other. If the interference is to be resolved then no information about whether the _InterferenceGeometry_ should be subtracted from the _RelatingElement_ or the _RelatedElement_ can be traced. This would be the case for clash detection results.
* _ImpliedOrder_=UNKNOWN No information about the priorities is provided.

The _InterferenceType_ property optionally specifies the type of interference between the two elements, two set of default types are provided:

* **Oriented interferences types** imply usage of _ImpliedOrder_ set to TRUE and specific choice of _RelatingElement_ and _RelatedElement_ to be meaningful:
  * Crosses: the _RelatingElement_ is crossing the _RelatedElement_ (e.g. Railway crossing a road)
  * PassesThrough: the _RelatingElement_ is passing through the _RelatedElement_ (e.g. a Road passing inside a tunnel)
  * PassesOver: the _RelatingElement_ is passing over the _RelatedElement_ (e.g a bridge passing over a water canal)
  * PassesUnder: the _RelatingElement_ is passing under the _RelatedElement_ (e.g a Tunnel passing under a road)
* **Non oriented interferences types** do not imply specific values of _ImpliedOrder_ (but can still be set to detail shape interference calculation)
  * Clash: The _RelatingElement_ and _RelatedElement_ have a spatial or shape-based clash
  * Along: The _RelatingElement_ and _RelatedElement_ have a common frontier/surface

# IfcRelSpaceBoundary

The space boundary defines the physical or virtual delimiter of a space by the relationship _IfcRelSpaceBoundary_ to the surrounding elements.
<!-- end of short definition -->

* In the case of a physical space boundary, the placement and shape of the boundary may be given, and the building element, providing the boundary is referenced,
* In the case of a virtual space boundary, the placement and shape of the boundary may be given, and a virtual element is referenced.

The _IfcRelSpaceBoundary_ is defined as an objectified relationship that handles the element to space relationship by objectifying the relationship between an element and the space it bounds. It is given as a one-to-one relationship, but allows each element (including virtual elements and openings) to define many such relationships and each space to be defined by many such relationships.

Space boundaries are always defined as seen from the space. In general two basic types of space boundaries are distinguished:

* 1<sup>st</sup> level space boundary: defined as boundaries of the space, not taking into account any change in building element or spaces on the other side.
* 2<sup>nd</sup> level space boundary: defined as boundary taking any change in building element or spaces on the other side into account. It can be further distinguished into
  * 2<sup>nd</sup> level type A: There is a space on the other side.
  * 2<sup>nd</sup> level type B: There is a building element on the other side.

The exact definition of how space boundaries are broken down depends on the view definition, more detailed conventions on how space boundaries are decomposed can only be given at the domain or application type level.

* In an architectural or FM related view, a space boundary is defined totally from inside the space. This is a 1<sup>st</sup> level space boundary.
* In a thermal view, the decomposition of the space boundary depends on the material of the providing building element and the adjacent spaces behind. This is a 2<sup>nd</sup> level space boundary.

![1st level](../../../../figures/ifcrelspaceboundary_1stlevel.png)

Figure 3 — Space boundary at second level type A

![2nd level type b](../../../../figures/ifcrelspaceboundary_2ndlevel_typeb.png)
Figure 4 — Space boundary at second level type B

The differences between the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> level space boundaries are identified by:

* **1<sup>st</sup> level:**  _IfcRoot.Name_ = "1stLevel"  _IfcRoot.Description_ = NIL
* **2<sup>nd</sup> level:**  _IfcRoot.Name_ = "2ndLevel"  _IfcRoot.Description_ = "2a", or "2b"

Differentiation between physical and virtual space boundary is illustrated in Figure 5 and Figure 6.

As shown in Figure 5, if the _IfcRelSpaceBoundary_ is used to express a virtual boundary, the attribute _PhysicalOrVirtualBoundary_ has to be set to _VIRTUAL_. The attribute _RelatedBuildingElement_ shall point to an instance of _IfcVirtualElement_. If the correct location is of interest, the attribute _ConnectionGeometry_ is required.

> NOTE The connection geometry, either by a 2D curve or a 3D surface, is used to describe the portion of the "virtual wall" that separates the two spaces. All instances of _IfcRelSpaceBoundary_ given at the adjacent spaces share the same instance of _IfcVirtualElement_. Each instance of _IfcRelSpaceBoundary_ provides in addition the _ConnectionGeometry_ given within the local placement of each space.

![IfcRelSpaceBoundary_virtual (35K)](../../../../figures/ifcrelspaceboundary_virtual.png "Figure 5 — Space boundary of virtual element")

As shown in Figure 6, if the _IfcRelSpaceBoundary_ is used to express a physical boundary between two spaces, the attribute _PhysicalOrVirtualBoundary_ has to be set to _PHYSICAL_. The attribute _RelatedBuildingElement_ has to be given and points to the element providing the space boundary. The attribute _ConnectionGeometry_ may be inserted, in this case it describes the physical space boundary geometrically, or it may be omitted; in that case it describes a physical space boundary logically.

![IfcRelSpaceBoundary_physical (35K)](../../../../figures/ifcrelspaceboundary_physical.png "Figure 6 — Space boundary of physical element")

The _IfcRelSpaceBoundary_ may have geometry attached. If geometry is not attached, the relationship between space and building element is handled only on a logical level. If geometry is attached, it is given within the local coordinate systems of the space.

> NOTE The attributes _CurveOnRelatingElement_ at _IfcConnectionCurveGeometry_ or _SurfaceOnRelatingElement_ at _IfcConnectionSurfaceGeometry_ provide the geometry within the local coordinate system of the _IfcSpace_, whereas the attributes _CurveOnRelatedElement_ at _IfcConnectionCurveGeometry_ or _SurfaceOnRelatedElement_ at _IfcConnectionSurfaceGeometry_ provide the geometry within the local coordinate system of the subtype of _IfcElement_.

The geometric representation (through the _ConnectionGeometry_ attribute) is defined using either 2D curve geometry or 3D surface geometry for space boundaries.

* 1<sup>st</sup> level space boundary:
  * only connection geometry for related space shall be provided
  * only surface connection geometry shall be provided
  * only the following surface representations are supported:
    * _IfcSurfaceOfLinearExtrusion_

# IfcRelSpaceBoundary1stLevel

The 1st level space boundary defines the physical or virtual delimiter of a space by the relationship _IfcRelSpaceBoundary1stLevel_ to the surrounding elements. 1st level space boundaries are characterized by:

* 1st level space boundaries are the boundaries of a space defined by the surfaces of building elements bounding this space (physical space boundaries) or by virtual surfaces provided by an adjacent space with no dividing wall.
* 1st level space boundaries do not consider any change of material in the bounding building elements, or different spaces/zones behind a wall or slab (floor or ceiling).
* 1st level space boundaries are differentiated in two ways: virtual or physical and internal,external, or undefined (internal and external) e.g. for a wall that is partially inside and outside.
* 1st level space boundaries form a closed shell around the space (so long as the space is completely enclosed) and include overlapping boundaries representing openings (filled or not) in the building elements (see implementers agreement below).
<!-- end of short definition -->

1st level space boundaries define a space by its boundary surfaces without taking anything on the other side of the bounding elements into account.

> NOTE 1st level space boundaries are used e.g. in quantity take-off and facility management as they describe the surfaces for finishes. They cannot be directly used for thermal analysis. However 1st level space boundaries can provide the input to preprocessors to thermal analysis software that take 1st level space boundaries and perform the necessary transformation into 2nd level space boundaries that are required for energy analysis.

# IfcRelSpaceBoundary2ndLevel

The 2nd level space boundary defines the physical or virtual delimiter of a space by the relationship _IfcRelSpaceBoundary2ndLevel_ to the surrounding elements. 2nd level space boundaries are characterized by:

* 2nd level space boundaries still represent building elements that bound the space, but are more granular in that they are subdivided in any of the following cases:
  * Differences in materials and/or material assemblies (for example, a wainscot or paneling on the lower portion of a wall).
  * Differences in spaces or zones on the other side of the building element (or virtual boundary) represented by the space boundary (for example, two different spaces on the other side of a wall)
* 2nd level space boundaries are differentiated in two ways: virtual or physical and internal or external, whereby any space boundary that is both internal and external has to be split into segments being either internal or external.
* 2nd level space boundaries represent both sides of a heat transfer surface separated by the thickness of the building element. They can be further differentiated in:
  * Type 2a that occurs when there is a space on the opposite side of the building element providing the space boundary
  * Type 2b occurs if there is a building element on the opposite side of the building element providing the space boundary.
* The connection geometry of 2nd level space boundaries is restricted to planar surfaces only. This means that curved surfaces must be segmented.
<!-- end of short definition -->

2nd level space boundaries define the heat transfer surfaces on both sides of building elements that separate spaces. The generation of 2nd level space boundaries has to take building elements and spaces on the other side into account.

# IfcSite

A site is a defined area of land, possibly covered with water, on which the project construction is to be completed. A site may be used to erect, retrofit or turn down building(s), or for other construction related developments.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> NOTE Definition according to ISO 6707-1: area of land or water where construction work or other development is undertaken.

Precise geospatial information of a site shall be derived from the georeferencing entities that relate the _IfcProject_ to the real world, using sets of datum (see _IfcCoordinateOperation_ and _IfcCoordinateReferenceSystem_).

In small-scale projects (e.g., building), when georeferencing is not provided as recommended above, the _Longitude_, _Latitude_ and _Elevation_ attributes of _IfcSite_ can be used for approximate indication of the site location. This methodology is not meant to replace precise georeferencing, but can still be useful for those use cases that do not require accurate geospatial information (e.g., sun shading simulations). If asserted, the _Longitude_, _Latitude_ and _Elevation_ establish the point in WGS84 where the point 0.,0.,0. of the _LocalPlacement_ of _IfcSite_ is situated.

The geometrical placement of the site, defined by the _IfcLocalPlacement_, shall be always relative to the spatial structure element, in which this site is included, or absolute, i.e. to the world coordinate system, as established by the geometric representation context of the project. The world coordinate system, established at the _IfcProject.RepresentationContexts_, may include a definition of the true north within the XY plane of the world coordinate system, if provided, it can be obtained at _IfcGeometricRepresentationContext.TrueNorth_.

A project may span over several connected or disconnected sites. Therefore site complex provides for a collection of sites included in a project. A site can also be decomposed in parts, where each part defines a site section. This is defined by the composition type attribute of the supertype _IfcSpatialStructureElement_ which is interpreted as follow:

* COMPLEX = site complex
* ELEMENT = site
* PARTIAL = site section

Figure SITECOMP shows the _IfcSite_ as part of the spatial structure. In addition to the logical spatial structure, also the placement hierarchy is shown. In this example the spatial structure hierarchy and the placement hierarchy are identical.

> NOTE Detailed requirements on mandatory element containment and placement structure relationships are given in view definitions and implementer agreements.

![IfcSite as part of a spatial structure](../../../../figures/ifcsite-spatialstructure.png)

Figure SITECOMP — Site composition

Figure SITELOC describes the heights and elevations of the _IfcSite_. It is used to provide the geographic longitude, latitude, and height above sea level for the origin of the site. The origin of the site is the local placement.

The provision of longitude, latitude, height at the _IfcSite_ for georeferencing is provided for upward compatibility reasons. It requires a single instance of _IfcSite_ and WGS84 as coordinate reference system.

For exact georeferencing (or referencing to any other geographic coordinate system other than WSG84) the entities _IfcCoordinateReferenceSystem_ and _IfcMapConversion_ have to be used to define an exact mapping of the project engineering coordinate system to the geographic (or map) coordinate system.

* <small>reference height of site is provided by: <em>IfcSite.RefElevation</em>, it is given according to the height datum used at this location.</small>
* <small>the reference height of each building situated at the site is given against the same height datum used at this location.</small>

## Attributes

### RefLatitude
World Latitude at reference point (most likely defined in legal description). Defined as integer values for degrees, minutes, seconds, and, optionally, millionths of seconds with respect to the world geodetic system WGS84.
> NOTE Latitudes are measured relative to the geodetic equator, north of the equator by positive values - from 0 till +90, south of the equator by negative values - from 0 till -90.

### RefLongitude
World Longitude at reference point (most likely defined in legal description). Defined as integer values for degrees, minutes, seconds, and, optionally, millionths of seconds with respect to the world geodetic system WGS84.
> NOTE Longitudes are measured relative to the geodetic zero meridian, nominally the same as the Greenwich prime meridian: longitudes west of the zero meridian have negative values - from 0 till -180, longitudes east of the zero meridian have positive values - from 0 till -180.

Address given to the site for postal purposes.

## Concepts

### Body Geometry

The body representation of IfcSite may be typically defined using a solid or surface model. Applicable solids are Breps and Tessellations. Applicable surface models are the IfcFaceBasedSurfaceModel and the IfcShellBasedSurfaceModel.

The representation identifier and type of this representation of IfcSite is:

* _IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationIdentifier_ = 'Body'
* _IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationType_ = 'Brep', or 'SurfaceModel'

### FootPrint GeomSet Geometry

The foot print representation of IfcSite is given by either a single 2D curve (such as IfcPolyline or IfcCompositeCurve), or by a list of 2D curves (in case of inner boundaries).

### Product Local Placement

The local placement for IfcSite is defined in its supertype IfcProduct. It is defined by the IfcLocalPlacement, which defines the local coordinate system that is referenced by all geometric representations.

* The PlacementRelTo relationship of IfcLocalPlacement shall point to the IfcSpatialStructureElement of type "IfcSite", if relative placement is used (e.g. to position a site relative a a site complex, or a site section to a site).
* If the relative placement is not used, the absolute placement is defined within the world coordinate system. If there is only one site object, then this is the default situation.

### Property Sets for Objects



### Quantity Sets



### Site Attributes



### Spatial Composition

By using the inverse relationship _IfcSite.Decomposes_ it references IfcProject || IfcSite through _IfcRelAggregates.RelatingObject_, If it refers to another instance of IfcSite, the referenced IfcSite needs to have a different and higher CompositionType, i.e. COMPLEX (if the other IfcSite has ELEMENT), or ELEMENT (if the other IfcSite has PARTIAL).

### Spatial Container

If there are building elements and/or other elements directly related to the IfcSite (like a fence, or a shear wall), they are associated with the IfcSite by using the objectified relationship IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure. The IfcSite references them by its inverse relationship:

* _IfcSite.ContainsElements_ -- referencing any subtype of IfcProduct (with the exception of other spatial structure element) by _IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure.RelatedElements_

### Spatial Decomposition

By using the inverse relationship _IfcSite.IsDecomposedBy_ it references (IfcSite || IfcBuilding || IfcSpace by _IfcRelAggregates.RelatedObjects_). If it refers to another instance of IfcSite, the referenced IfcSite needs to have a different and lower CompositionType, i.e. ELEMENT (if the other IfcSite has COMPLEX), or PARTIAL (if the other IfcSite has ELEMENT).

# IfcSpace

A space represents an area or volume bounded actually or theoretically. Spaces are areas or volumes that provide for certain functions within a building.
<!-- end of short definition -->

A space is associated to a building storey (or in case of exterior spaces to a site). A space may span over several connected spaces. Therefore a space group provides for a collection of spaces included in a storey. A space can also be decomposed in parts, where each part defines a partial space. This is defined by the _CompositionType_ attribute of the supertype _IfcSpatialStructureElement_ which is interpreted as follow:

* COMPLEX = space group
* ELEMENT = space
* PARTIAL = partial space

> NOTE View definitions and implementation agreements may restrict spaces with the same _CompositionType_ to be non-overlapping.
_
The _IfcSpace_ is used to build the spatial structure of a building (that serves as the primary project breakdown and is required to be hierarchical). The spatial structure elements are linked together by using the objectified relationship _IfcRelAggregates_.

Figure 1 shows the _IfcSpace_ as part of the spatial structure. It also serves as the spatial container for space related elements.

> NOTE Detailed requirements on mandatory element containment and placement structure relationships are given in view definitions and implementer agreements.

![spatial structure](../../../../figures/ifcspace-spatialstructure.png)

Figure 1 — Space composition

The following guidelines should apply for using the _Name_, _Description_, _LongName_ and _ObjectType_ attributes.

* _Name_ holds the unique name (or space number) from the plan.
* _Description_ holds any additional information field the user may have specified, there are no further recommendations.
* _LongName_ holds the full name of the space, it is often used in addition to the _Name_, if a number is assigned to the room, then the descriptive name is exchanged as _LongName_.
* _ObjectType_ holds the space type, i.e. usually the functional category of the space .

> NOTE In cases of inconsistency between the geometric representation of the _IfcSpace_ and the combined geometric representations of the surrounding _IfcRelSpaceBoundary_, the geometric representation of the space should take priority over the geometric representation of the surrounding space boundaries.

Figure 2 describes the heights and elevations of the _IfcSpace_.

* elevation of the space (top of construction slab) equals elevation of storey: provided by _IfcBuildingStorey.Elevation_ relative to _IfcBuilding.ElevationOfRefHeight_
* elevation of the space flooring (top of flooring on top of slab): provided by _IfcSpace.ElevationWithFlooring_ relative to _IfcBuilding.ElevationOfRefHeight_
* height of space (top of slab below to bottom of slab above): provided by BaseQuantity with Name="Height"
* floor height of space (top of slab below to top of flooring): provided by BaseQuantity with Name="FinishFloorHeight"

## Concepts

### Body Brep Geometry

The space can be represented by a brep geometry representation

### Body Clipping Geometry

The following additional constraints apply to the advanced representation:

* **Solid**: IfcExtrudedAreaSolid is required,
* **Profile**: IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef is required, IfcArbitraryProfileDefWithVoids shall be supported.
* **Extrusion**: The extrusion direction shall be vertically, i.e., along the positive Z Axis of the co-ordinate system of the containing spatial structure element.
* **Boolean result**: The difference operation with the second operand being of type IfcHalfSpaceSolid (or one of its subtypes) shall be supported.

Figure 185 shows an extrusion of an arbitrary profile definition into the swept area solid. The solid and an half space solid are operands of the Boolean result of IfcSpace.

### FootPrint GeomSet Geometry

The following constraints apply to the 2D representation:

* An IfcBoundedCurve is required, using IfcPolyline for faceted space contours or IfcCompositeCurve for space contours with arc segments. For spaces with inner boundaries, a set of IfcBoundedCurve's is used, that should be grouped into an IfcGeometricCurveSet.

* The PlacementRelTo relationship of IfcLocalPlacement shall point to the local placement of the IfcSpatialStructureElement of type IfcBuildingStorey or IfcSite if relative placement is used.
* If the relative placement is not used, the absolute placement is defined within the world coordinate system.

The IfcSpace references them by its inverse relationship:

* _IfcSpace.ContainsElements_ -- referencing any subtype of IfcProduct (with the exception of other spatial structure element) by _IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure.RelatedElements_.

# IfcSpatialElementType

_IfcSpatialElementType_ defines a list of commonly shared property set definitions of a spatial structure element and an optional set of product representations. It is used to define a spatial element specification (the specific element information, that is common to all occurrences of that element type).
<!-- end of short definition -->

> NOTE  The product representations are defined as representation maps (at the level of the supertype _IfcTypeProduct_, which gets assigned by an element occurrence instance through the _IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]_ being an _IfcMappedItem_.

A spatial element type is used to define the common properties of a certain type of a spatial structure element that may be applied to many instances of that type to assign a specific style. Spatial element types (i.e. the instantiable subtypes) may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.

> NOTE  The spatial element types are often used to represent catalogues of predefined spatial types for shared attributes, less so for sharing a common representation map.

The occurrences of subtypes of the abstract _IfcSpatialElementType_ are represented by instances of subtypes of the abstract _IfcSpatialElement_.

## Attributes

### ElementType
The type denotes a particular type that indicates the object further. The use has to be established at the level of instantiable subtypes. In particular it holds the user defined type, if the enumeration of the attribute 'PredefinedType' is set to USERDEFINED.

# IfcSpatialStructureElement

A spatial structure element is the generalization of all spatial elements that might be used to define a spatial structure. The spatial structure can be used to provide a spatial organization of a project.
<!-- end of short definition -->

A spatial project structure might define as many levels of decomposition as necessary for the project. Elements within the spatial project structure are:

* site as _IfcSite_
* facility as _IfcFacility_, or specifically
  * building as _IfcBuilding_
  * bridge as _IfcBridge_
  * marine facility as _IfcMarineFacility_
  * railway as _IfcRailway_
  * road as _IfcRoad_

* facility part as _IfcFacilityPart_, or specifically
  * storey as _IfcBuildingStorey_
  * facility part as _IfcFacilityPart_

* space as _IfcSpace_

or aggregations or parts thereof. The composition type declares an element to be either an element itself, or an aggregation (complex) or a decomposition (part). The interpretation of these types is given at each subtype of _IfcSpatialStructureElement_.

The _IfcRelAggregates_ is defined as an 1-to-many relationship and used to establish the relationship between exactly two levels within the spatial project structure. Finally the highest level of the spatial structure is assigned to _IfcProject_ using the _IfcRelAggregates_.

The subtypes of _IfcSpatialStructureElement_ relate to other elements and systems by establishing the following relationships:

* **Containment of elements** : _IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure_ by inverse attribute _ContainsElements_, used to assign any element, like building elements, MEP elements, etc. to the spatial structure element in which they are primarily contained.
* **Reference of elements** : _IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure_ by inverse attribute _ReferencesElements_, used to reference any element, like building elements, MEP elements, etc. in spatial structure elements, other then the one, where it is contained. Since the deprecation of _IfcRelServicesBuildings_, _IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure_ is also used to reference a system, like a building service or electrical distribution system, a zonal system, or a structural analysis system, that is assigned to this spatial structure element.

The subtypes of _IfcSpatialStructureElement_ relate to each other by using the _IfcRelAggregates_ relationship to build the project spatial structure. Figure 1 shows the use of _IfcRelAggregates_ to establish a spatial structure including site, building, building section and storey. More information is provided at the level of the subtypes.

![fig1](../../../../figures/ifcspatialstructureelement-spatialstructure.png)

> HISTORY New entity in IFC2x.

**Informal Propositions**

1. The spatial project structure, established by the _IfcRelAggregates_, shall be acyclic.
2. A site should not be (directly or indirectly) associated to a building, storey or space.
3. A building should not be (directly or indirectly) associated to a storey or space.
4. A storey should not be (directly or indirectly) associated to a space.

## Attributes

### CompositionType
Denotes, whether the predefined spatial structure element represents itself, or an aggregate (complex) or a part (part). The interpretation is given separately for each subtype of spatial structure element. If no _CompositionType_ is asserted, the default value ''ELEMENT'' applies.

> IFC4 CHANGE Attribute made optional.

## Formal Propositions

All spatial structure elements shall be associated (using the _IfcRelAggregates_ relationship) with another spatial structure element, or with IfcProject.

# IfcSpatialZone

A spatial zone is a non-hierarchical and potentially overlapping decomposition of the project under some functional consideration. A spatial zone might be used to represent a thermal zone, a construction zone, a lighting zone, a usable area zone. A spatial zone might have its independent placement and shape representation.
<!-- end of short definition -->

The _IfcSpatialZone_ inherits and declares these attributes that shall have the following meaning:

* _Name_: A number or designator provided by the user or system for the spatial element
* _LongName_: Name of the spatial element provided by the user
* _Description_: Any additional description provided by the user
* _ObjectType_: reserved for typing of spatial elements in case of _PredefinedType_ = .USERDEFINED., restrictions on applicable values might be published in view definitions or implementer agreements.

> EXAMPLE A _Name_ could be "1-003", typically a running number provided by default by the application. _LongName_ may be "Office", and _Description_ may be "Corner office with habour view".

Physical elements that are referenced by this spatial zone are related using the _IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure_ relationship as it is a non-hierarchical assignment in addition to the hierarchical spatial containment within a subtype of _IfcSpatialStructureElement_. Also spaces, that are referenced by this spatial zone are related using the _IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure_ relationship. The _IfcSpatialZone_ itself can also be referenced by another spatial element using _IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure_.

# IfcTransportElement

A transport element is a generalization of all transport related objects that move people, animals or goods within a Facility. The _IfcTransportElement_ defines the occurrence of a transport element, that (if given), is expressed by the _IfcTransportElementType_.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> EXAMPLE Transportation elements include elevator (lift), escalator, moving walkway, etc.

> NOTE More detailed equipment that may be a part of a transportation device, like a lifting hook, is defined as _IfcDiscreteAccessory_. It maybe included as a part of the _IfcTransportElement_ by virtue of the objectified relationship _IfcRelAggregates_.

Transport element can describe fixed or non fixed elements, which can either be identified as specified operational assets within a facility or vehicles that interact with the facility as a user or customer.
In the case of operational assets, instances of _IfcTransportElement_ can represent individual identifiable vehicles or structures with properties such as serial numbers, registration numbers etc. and be typed accordingly by instances of _IfcTransportElementType_.

In the case of transport elements that interact as users or customers, such as cars on a road or vessels at a port, _IfcTransportElementType_ is used to define element specifications which are used to design, analyse and provide operational constraints to the facility.

Depending on local classification systems transport elements and transportation systems in buildings are either considered as part of a built system, or as part of a built service system. Within IFC they are considered as part of a built system and may have to be mapped appropriately.

# IfcVirtualElement

A virtual element is a special element used to provide imaginary, placeholder, or provisional areas, volumes, and boundaries. Virtual elements are usually not displayed and do not have quantities, associated materials, and other measures.
<!-- end of short definition -->

Uses of _IfcVirtualElement_ include:

 * An imaginary boundary such as between two adjacent, but not separated, spaces. The _IfcVirtualElement_ may provide the 2D curve or 3D surface representation of the virtual space connection and is referenced by two instances of _IfcRelSpaceBoundary_, each pointing to one of the two adjacent _IfcSpaces_. The boundary is exchanged using _PredefinedType_ = BOUNDARY.
 * A provision for voids. Such as where a particular volume of space is requested by an engineering function that might later be accepted or rejected. If accepted it is transformed into a void within a building element, like a wall opening, or a slab opening. The provision for voids is exchanged using the _PredefinedType_ = PROVISIONFORVOID. Typically this shall use a swept solid geometry, where the profile of the swept solid lies on/near the surface of the referred building element and the extrusion depths is equal to or bigger then (in case of round or otherwise irregular element shape) the thickness of the building element. The appropriate property set _Pset_ProvisionForVoid_ should be attached.
 * A clearance space. Typically a placeholder for the necessary space allocation for future designed elements, such as mechanical equipment that will be determined in a later design phase. It is also used for structure gauge. The clearance is exchanged using the _PredefinedType_ = CLEARANCE.

Figure 1 describes how to use _IfcRelSpaceBoundary_ in conjunction with _IfcVirtualElement_ to define space boundaries.

### Material Single

It is illegal to assign an _IfcMaterial_ to an _IfcVirtualElement_ with the _PredefinedType_ = PROVISIONFORVOID.

### FootPrint Geometry

### Surface Geometry

The 3D geometric representation of IfcVirtualElement is defined using a surface geometry. The following constraints apply to the 3D surface representation:

 * 'Surface3D': _IfcSurfaceOfLinearExtrusion_, _IfcCurveBoundedPlane_, _IfcCurveBoundedSurface_, _IfcRectangularTrimmedSurface_
 * 'GeometricSet': a list of 3D surfaces within the constraints shown above.

In case of an _IfcSurfaceOfLinearExtrusion_:

 * Profile: _IfcArbitraryOpenProfileDef_
 * Extrusion: The extrusion direction shall be vertically, i.e., along the positive Z Axis of the coordinate system of the containing spatial structure element.

In case of an _IfcCurveBoundedPlane_, _IfcCurveBoundedSurface_, _IfcRectangularTrimmedSurface_:

 * Extrusion: The _BasisSurface_ shall be a surface that is upright, i.e. standing perpendicular to the xy place of the coordinate system of the containing spatial structure element.

# IfcZone

A zone is a group of spaces, partial spaces or other zones. These spaces may or may not be adjacent. A zone does not have its own shape representation. Zone structures may not be hierarchical (in contrary to the spatial structure of a project - see _IfcSpatialStructureElement_), i.e. one individual _IfcSpace_ may be associated with zero, one, or several _IfcZone_'s. _IfcSpace_'s are grouped into an _IfcZone_ by using the objectified relationship _IfcRelAssignsToGroup_ as specified at the supertype _IfcGroup_. For example, a zone might be used to represent an apartment as a group of spaces.
<!-- end of short definition -->

{ .change-ifc2x4}

## Formal Propositions

### WR1
An _IfcZone_ is grouped by the objectified relationship _IfcRelAssignsToGroup_. Only objects of type _IfcSpace_, _IfcZone_ and _IfcSpatialZone_ are allowed as _RelatedObjects_.

## Concepts

### Group Assignment

An IfcZone is a spatial system under which individual IfcSpace's (and other IfcZone's) are grouped. In contrary to the IfcSpatialZone entity, IfcZone is a mere grouping, it can not define an own geometric representation and placement. Therefore it cannot be used for spatial zones having a different shape and size compared to the shape and size of aggregated spaces.

> NOTE The IfcZone is regarded as the spatial system (as compared to the building service, electrical, or analytical system), the name remains IfcZone for compatibility reasons, instead of using a proper naming convention, like IfcSpatialSystem.

> NOTE  One of the purposes of a zone is to define a fire compartmentation. In this case it defines the geometric information about the fire compartment (through the contained spaces) and information, whether this compartment is ventilated or sprinkler protected. In addition the fire risk code and the hazard type can be added, the coding is normally defined within a national fire regulation. All that information is available within the relevant property sets. Again, if an independent shape has to be provided to the fire compartment, then the entity IfcSpatialZone shall be used.

In case of a zone denoting a (fire) compartment, the following types should be used, if applicable, as values of the ObjectType attribute:

* **'FireCompartment'**: a zone of spaces, collected to represent a single fire compartment.
* **'ElevatorShaft'**: a collection of spaces within an elevator, potentially going through many storeys.
* **'RisingDuct'**: A collection of vertical airspaces.
* **'RunningDuct'**: A collection of horizontal airspaces.

IfcProductExtension
===================

The _IfcProductExtension_ further specialises the concepts of a (physical) product, i.e. a component likely to have a shape and a placement within the project context. The product information is provided for individual product occurrences as subtypes of _IfcProduct_, and for common specific product types as subtypes of _IfcTypeProduct_. Both definitions are rooted in supertypes provided within the _IfcKernel_. Basis concepts, introduced within the _IfcProductExtension_, are:

* the spatial project structure,
* the element,
* the grid,
* the port, and 
* the annotation.

The spatial project structure defines

* the site, 
* the facility (building, bridge, marine, railway, road),
* the facility part (building storey and parts of the above), and 
* the space 

and its decomposition structure. In addition the concepts of system and zone are introduced within the _IfcProductExtension_. Relationships between the spatial structure and the elements are defined, such as spatial containment and space boundaries.

An element is assigned to the spatial project structure and may refer by its placement to a grid. Basic types of elements, which are introduced are

* building element
* opening element
* furnishing element
* distribution element (including heating, ventilation, air conditioning, electrical and equipment elements)
* transportation element

The other concepts introduced are

* a grid, providing a constraint placement for elements, 
* an alignment, providing a linear positioning element to position geographic and civil elements,<br>
  with project geo referencing provided by means of entities from the IfcRepresentationResource domain,
* an annotation to capture any additional annotations to a building model or plan (such as explanatory text, dimensioning, etc.), and
* a port, providing connectivity between elements.

### KILOPOINT
Kilo point

Mile point

### STATION
Station

### REFERENCEMARKER
The reference marker is a notation referent, typically located in the right of way of the road, rail or other transportation system. Usually reference markers are initially spaced at a uniform distance along the linear element being measured, though subsequent re-alignments can result in uneven spacing between the markers.

> NOTE definition from ISO 19148:2021

> NOTE The physical manifestation of the _IfcReferent.REFERENCEMARKER_ can be an _IfcSign.MARKER_ (e.g., a bolt fixed on a post)

### LANDMARK
The referent is the location of a physical landmark visible in the field.

> NOTE definition from ISO 19148:2021

### BOUNDARY
The referent represents where an administrative or maintenance boundary crosses the linear element being measured. This is typically the first time the boundary crosses the linear element. If the boundary runs along the linear element, it would be the point at which they first become collinear. The LRS (linear referencing system) should include specific rules about how boundaries are handled if this type of referent is permitted. If the linear element changes at the boundary as for a county route beginning at the county boundary, then the LRM (linear referencing method) is more correctly categorized as absolute.

> NOTE definition from ISO 19148:2021

### INTERSECTION
The referent is the location of an intersection specified by the referent name. The intersection location is typically taken as the location of the intersection of the reference lines of the streets comprising the intersection and is, therefore, not necessarily precise or deterministic. Physical markers can be installed to remedy this. The LRS (linear referencing system) should include specific rules about how intersection locations are determined if this type of referent is permitted.

> NOTE definition from ISO 19148:2021

### POSITION
Used to fully describe a linearly referenced location given by the linear element being measured (the _IfcAlignment_ into which the _IfcReferent_ is nested), the method of measurement (_Pset_LinearReferencingMethod_) and a measure value (_Pset_Stationing_). If a linear referencing method is specified for the position, it overrides any linear referencing method specified for the alignment.

### WIDTHEVENT
A kind of event that specifies the width at a specific location along a road alignment, and the type of transition from the previous location. The locations are specified using an IfcLinearPlacement measured along the alignment axis curve.
The element(s) that are affected by the width event is currently proposed to be specified by containing the event in a specific lateral breakdown element of the road spatial structure (e.g. a Lane or the entire carriageway).

### SUPERELEVATIONEVENT
A kind of event that specifies the superelevation (cross slope) at a specific location along a road alignment, and the type of transition from the previous location. The locations are specified using an IfcLinearPlacement measured along the alignment axis curve.

The element(s) that are affected by the superelevation event is currently proposed to be specified by containing the event in a specific lateral breakdown element of the road spatial structure (e.g. a Lane).

# IfcDoorLiningProperties

The door lining is the frame which enables the door leaf to be fixed in position. The door lining is used to hang the door leaf. The parameters of the door lining define the geometrically relevant parameter of the lining.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> NOTE The _IfcDoorLiningProperties_ shall only be applied by the receiving application to parametrically define the 3D shape of a door, if the attribute _IfcDoorType_.ParameterTakesPrecedence is set TRUE.

The _IfcDoorLiningProperties_ are included in the list of properties of _IfcDoorType_.HasPropertySets. More information about the door lining can be included in the same list of the _IfcDoorType_ using another _IfcPropertySet_ for dynamic extensions.

The _IfcDoorLiningProperties_ does not hold its own geometric representation. However it defines parameters which can be used to create the shape of the door type (which is inserted by the _IfcDoor_ into the spatial context of the project) as described below. The parameters of the _IfcDoorLiningProperties_ define a standard door lining, including (if given) a threshold and a transom. The outer boundary of the lining is determined by the 'Profile' shape representation assigned to the _IfcDoor_, which inserts the _IfcDoorType_.

![lining 1](../../../../figures/ifcdoorliningproperties-fig01.png)

The lining is applied to the left, right and upper side of the opening reveal. The parameters are:

 * LiningDepth, if omitted, equal to wall thickness - this only takes effect if a value for <em>LiningThickness</em> is given. If both parameters are not given, then there is no lining.</li>
 * LiningThickness
 * LiningToPanelOffsetX
 * LiningToPanelOffsetY

> NOTE The parameters <em>LiningToPanelOffsetX</em> and <em>LiningToPanelOffsetY</em> are added in IFC4.

![lining 2](../../../../figures/ifcdoorliningproperties-fig02.png)

The lining can only cover part of the opening reveal.

 * LiningOffset, given if lining edge has an offset to the x axis of the local placement.

> NOTE In addition to the <em>LiningOffset</em>, the local placement of the <em>IfcDoor</em> can already have an offset to the wall edge and thereby shift the lining along the y axis. The actual position of the lining is calculated from the origin of the local placement along the positive y axis with the distance given by <em>LiningOffset</em>.

![lining 3](../../../../figures/ifcdoorliningproperties-fig03.png)

The lining may include a casing, which covers part of the wall faces around the opening. The casing covers the left, right and upper side of the lining on both sides of the wall. The parameters are:

 * CasingDepth
 * CasingThickness

![lining 4](../../../../figures/ifcdoorliningproperties-fig04.png)

The lining may include a threshold, which covers the bottom side of the opening. The parameters are:

 * ThresholdDepth, if omitted, equal to wall thickness - this only takes effect if a value for <em>ThresholdThickness</em> is given. If both parameters are not given, then there is no threshold.
 * ThresholdThickness
 * ThresholdOffset (not shown in figure), given, if the threshold edge has an offset to the x axis of the local placement.

![lining 5](../../../../figures/ifcdoorliningproperties-fig05.png)

The lining may have a transom which separates the door panel from a window panel. The transom, if given, is defined by:

 * TransomOffset, a parallel edge to the x axis of the local placement
 * TransomThickness

The depth of the transom is identical to the depth of the lining and not given as separate parameter.

> NOTE _LiningDepth_ describes the length of the lining along the reveal of the door opening. It can be given by an absolute value if the door lining has a specific depth depending on the door style. However often it is equal to the wall thickness. If the same door style is used (like the same type of single swing door), but inserted into different walls with different thicknesses, it would be necessary to create a special door style for each wall thickness. Therefore several CAD systems allow to set the value to "automatically aligned" to wall thickness. This should be exchanged by leaving the optional attribute LiningDepth unassigned. The same agreement applies to _ThresholdDepth_.

## Attributes

### LiningDepth
Depth of the door lining, measured perpendicular to the plane of the door lining. If omitted (and with a given value to lining thickness) it indicates an adjustable depth (i.e. a depth that adjusts to the thickness of the wall into which the occurrence of this door style is inserted).

### LiningThickness
Thickness of the door lining as explained in the figure above. If _LiningThickness_ value is 0. (zero) it denotes a door without a lining (all other lining parameters shall be set to NIL in this case). If the _LiningThickness_ is NIL it denotes that the value is not available.

If omitted (and with a given value to threshold thickness) it indicates an adjustable depth (i.e. a depth that adjusts to the thickness of the wall into which the occurrence of this door style is inserted).

### ThresholdThickness
Thickness of the door threshold as explained in the figure above. If _ThresholdThickness_ value is 0. (zero) it denotes a door without a threshold (_ThresholdDepth_ shall be set to NIL in this case). If the _ThresholdThickness_ is NIL it denotes that the information about a threshold is not available.
{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE Data type modified to be _IfcNonNegativeLengthMeasure_.

### TransomThickness
Thickness (width in plane parallel to door leaf) of the transom (if provided - that is, if the _TransomOffset_ attribute is set), which divides the door leaf from a glazing (or window) above.
If the _TransomThickness_ is set to zero (and the _TransomOffset_ set to a positive length), then the door is divided vertically into a leaf and transom window area without a physical frame.
{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE Data type changed to _IfcNonNegativeLengthMeasure_.

### TransomOffset
Offset of the transom (if given) which divides the door leaf from a glazing (or window) above. The offset is given from the bottom of the door opening.

### LiningOffset
Offset (dimension in plane perpendicular to door leaf) of the door lining. The offset is given as distance to the x axis of the local placement.

### ThresholdOffset
Offset (dimension in plane perpendicular to door leaf) of the door threshold. The offset is given as distance to the x axis of the local placement. Only given if the door lining includes a threshold and the parameter is known.

### CasingThickness
Thickness of the casing (dimension in plane of the door leaf). If given it is applied equally to all four sides of the adjacent wall.

### CasingDepth
Depth of the casing (dimension in plane perpendicular to door leaf). If given it is applied equally to all four sides of the adjacent wall.

### ShapeAspectStyle
Pointer to the shape aspect, if given. The shape aspect reflects the part of the door shape, which represents the door lining.
{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE The attribute is deprecated and shall no longer be used, i.e. the value shall be NIL ($).

### LiningToPanelOffsetX
Offset between the lining and the window panel measured along the x-axis of the local placement.

# IfcDoorPanelProperties

A door panel is normally a door leaf that opens to allow people or goods to pass. The parameters of the door panel define the geometrically relevant parameter of the panel,
<!-- end of short definition -->

The _IfcDoorPanelProperties_ are used to parametrically describe the shape and operation of door panels. The parametric definition can be added solely or additionally to the explicit shape representation of the door.

The _IfcDoorType_ can define doors consisting of more then one panel. In this case, one instance of _IfcDoorPanelProperties_ has to be included for each door panel. The _PanelPosition_ attribute, in conjunction with the _IfcDoorType.OperationType_ attribute, determines to which panel the _IfcDoorPanelProperties_ apply. The _IfcDoorPanelProperties_ are included in the list of properties , given by attribute _HasPropertySets_ of the _IfcDoorType_. More information about the door panel can be included in the same list of the _IfcDoorType_ using the _IfcPropertySet_ for dynamic extensions.

The _IfcDoorPanelProperties_ does not hold a geometric representation. However it defines parameters which can be used to create the shape of the door type(which is inserted by the _IfcDoor_ into the spatial context of the project) as shown in Table 1.

The parameters of the _IfcDoorPanelProperties_ define a standard door panel, including (if given) a proportional width to define non-uniform double swing (or sliding, or folding) doors. The outer boundary of the panel is determined by the 'Profile' shape representation assigned to the _IfcDoor_, which inserts the _IfcDoorType_. It has to take the lining parameter into account as well.

# IfcPermeableCoveringProperties

This entity is a description of a panel within a door or window (as fillers for opening) which allows for air flow. It is given by its properties (_IfcPermeableCoveringProperties_). A permeable covering is a casement, such as a component, fixed or opening, consisting essentially of a frame and the infilling. The infilling is normally a grill, a louver or a screen. The way of operation is defined in the operation type.
<!-- end of short definition -->

The _IfcPermeableCoveringProperties_ are included in the list of properties (_HasPropertySets_) of the _IfcWindowType_ or the _IfcDoorType_. More information about the permeable covering can be included in the same list of the window or door style using the _IfcPropertySet_ for dynamic extensions. This particularly applies for additional properties for the various operation types

The _IfcPermeableCoveringProperties_ does not hold a geometric representation. However it defines parameters which can be used to create the shape of the _IfcWindowType_ (which is inserted by the _IfcWindow_ into the spatial context of the project), or of the _IfcDoorType_ (which is inserted by the _IfcDoor_).

The parameters at the _IfcPermeableCoveringProperties_ define a standard permeable covering. The outer boundary of the panel is determined by the occurrence parameter assigned to the _IfcWindow_ or _IfcDoor_. It has to take the lining parameter into account as well. The position of the permeable covering within the overall window or door is determined by the _PanelPosition_ attribute.

Figure 1 illustrates the panel applied to the position within the lining, as defined by the panel position attribute. The following parameters apply to that panel: _FrameDepth_, _FrameThickness_.

# IfcWindowLiningProperties

The window lining is the outer frame which enables the window to be fixed in position. The window lining is used to hold the window panels or other casements. The parameter of the _IfcWindowLiningProperties_ define the geometrically relevant parameter of the lining.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> NOTE The _IfcWindowLiningProperties_ shall only be applied to construct the 3D shape of a window, if the attribute _IfcWindowType_.ParameterTakesPrecedence is set TRUE.

The _IfcWindowLiningProperties_ are included in the set of properties of _IfcWindowType.HasPropertySets_. More information about the window lining can be included in the same set of the _IfcWindowType_ using another _IfcPropertySet_ for dynamic extensions.

The _IfcWindowLiningProperties_ does not hold a geometric representation. However it defines parameters which can be used to create the shape of the window type(which is inserted by the _IfcWindow_ into the spatial context of the project) as shown in Figure 1. The parameters at the _IfcWindowLiningProperties_ define a standard window lining, including (if given) a mullion and a transom (for horizontal and vertical splits). The outer boundary of the lining is determined by the 'Profile' shape representation assigned to the _IfcWindow_, which inserts the _IfcWindowType_.

# IfcWindowPanelProperties

A window panel is a casement, that is, a component, fixed or opening, consisting essentially of a frame and the infilling. The infilling of a window panel is normally glazing. The way of operation is defined in the operation type.
<!-- end of short definition -->

The _IfcWindowPanelProperties_ are used to parametrically describe the shape and operation of window panels. The parametric definition can be added solely or additionally to the explicit shape representation of the window.

The _IfcWindowType_ can define windows consisting of more then one panel. In this case, one instance of _IfcWindowPanelProperties_ has to be included for each window panel. The _PanelPosition_ attribute, in conjunction with the _IfcWindowType_.OperationType attribute, determines to which panel the _IfcWindowPanelProperties_apply. The _IfcWindowPanelProperties_ are included in the list of properties (_HasPropertySets_) of the _IfcWindowType_. More information about the window panel can be included in the same list of the _IfcWindowType_ using the _IfcPropertySet_ for dynamic extensions.

The _IfcWindowPanelProperties_ does not hold an own geometric representation. However it defines parameter, which can be used to create the shape of the _IfcWindowType_ (which is inserted by the _IfcWindow_ into the spatial context of the project). The parameters at the _IfcWindowPanelProperties_ define a standard window panel.

It has to take the lining parameter into account as well. The position of the window panel within the overall window is determined by the _PanelPosition_ attribute.

As shown in Figure 1, the panel is applied to the position within the lining as defined by the panel position attribute. The following parameter apply to that panel: _FrameDepth_, _FrameThickness_.

For a door, it is the offset (dimension in plane perpendicular to door leaf) of the door lining. The offset is given as distance to the x axis of the local placement.

### LiningThickness
For a door, it is the thickness of the door lining as explained in the figure above. If _LiningThickness_ value is 0. (zero) it denotes a door without a lining (all other lining parameters shall be set to NIL in this case). If the _LiningThickness_ is NIL it denotes that the value is not available.

### LiningToPanelOffsetX
For a door, it is the offset between the lining and the window panel.

### LiningToPanelOffsetY
For a door, it is the offset between the lining and the door panel.

### TransomThickness
For a door, it is the thickness (width in plane parallel to door leaf) of the transom (if provided - that is, if the _TransomOffset_ attribute is set), which divides the door leaf from a glazing (or window) above. If the _TransomThickness_ is set to zero (and the _TransomOffset_ set to a positive length), then the door is divided vertically into a leaf and transom window area without a physical frame.

For a window, it is the thickness of the mullion (i.e., the vertical separator of window panels within a window), measured parallel to the window elevation plane. The mullion is part of the lining and the mullion depth is assumed to be identical to the lining depth. If the _MullionThickness_ is set to zero (and the _MullionOffset_ set to a positive length), then the window is divided horizontally without a physical divider.

### TransomThickness
For a window, it is the thickness of the transom (horizontal separator of window panels within a window), measured parallel to the window elevation plane. The transom is part of the lining and the transom depth is assumed to be identical to the lining depth. If the _TransomThickness_ is set to zero (and the _TransomOffset_ set to a positive length), then the window is divided vertically without a physical divider.

### FrameDepth
For a window, it is the depth of panel frame, measured from front face to back face horizontally (i.e. perpendicular to the window elevation plane).

### FrameThickness
For a window, it is the width of panel frame, measured from inside of panel (at glazing) to outside of panel (at lining), i.e. parallel to the window (elevation) plane.

### OperationType
For a window, it is the type of window panel operations. Also used to assign standard symbolic presentations according to national building standards.

### PanelPosition
For a window, it is the position of the panel within the overall window style.

IfcArchitectureDomain
=====================

The _IfcArchitectureDomain_ schema defines basic object concepts used in the architectural domain that have not been generalized and pushed lower in the model (such as shared with other domains or application types).

> NOTE  Most elements used in the architectural domain are shared with other domains and are consequently declared in lower level schemas, such as _IfcProductExtension_, or _IfcSharedBldgElements_.

Specific architectural elements that are not already covered by other schemas are defined here:

* door lining and panel parameters allowing for a limited parametric description of door shape and operation,
* window lining and panel parameters allowing for a limited parametric description of window shape and operation,
* specific permeable covering properties for window and door openings

These parameter definitions are used to enhance the specification of door and window elements, they are applied to _IfcDoorType_ and _IfcWindowType_ using the _HasPropertySets_ relation.

> HISTORY  New schema in IFC1.5

> DEPRECATION  Use of _IfcDoorStyle_ and _IfcWindowStyle_ has been deprecated in IFC4 and now deleted. Use _IfcDoorType_ and _IfcWindowType_ instead.

<!-- end of short definition -->

 HISTORY: In IFC4, SignalFactor1, SignalFactor2 and SignalFactor3 changed to ProportionalConstant, IntegralConstant and DerivativeConstant. SignalTime1 and SignalTime2 changed to SignalTimeIncrease and SignalTimeDecrease.


## Comments

### ControlType

PROPORTIONAL: Output is proportional to the control error. The gain of a proportional control (Kp) will have the effect of reducing the rise time and reducing , but never eliminating, the steady-state error of the variable controlled.
PROPORTIONALINTEGRAL: Part of the output is proportional to the control error and part is proportional to the time integral of the control error. Adding the gain of an integral control (Ki) will have the effect of eliminating the steady-state error of the variable controlled, but it may make the transient response worse.
PROPORTIONALINTEGRALDERIVATIVE: Part of the output is proportional to the control error, part is proportional to the time integral of the control error and part is proportional to the time derivative of the control error. Adding the gain of a derivative control (Kd) will have the effect of increasing the stability of the system, reducing the overshoot, and improving the transient response of the variable controlled.

### Value

The expected range and default value. While the property data type is IfcReal (to support all cases including when the units are unknown), a unit may optionally be provided to indicate the measure and unit.

## Comments

### SetPoint

Indicates the temperature setpoint. For thermostats with setbacks or separate high and low setpoints, then the time series may contain a pair of values at each entry where the first value is the heating setpoint (low) and the second value is the cooling setpoint (high).

### Temperature

Indicates the current measured temperature.

IfcBuildingControlsDomain
=========================

The _IfcBuildingControlsDomain_ schema forms part of the Domain Layer of the IFC Model. It extends the ideas concerning building services outlined in the _IfcSharedBldgServiceElements_ schema. It defines concepts of building automation, control, instrumentation and alarm.

The _IfcBuildingControlsDomain_ schema supports ideas including types and occurrences of:

* actuator
* alarm
* controller
* sensor
* flow instrument
* unitary control element

Elements that perform the control action such as valves and dampers are principally types of distribution flow element and are located in the _IfcHvacDomain_ and _IfcElectricalDomain_ schemas.

Occurrences of control elements capture design information, while realtime device state is captured on _IfcPerformanceHistory_, for which control elements may be assigned. Various standard property sets are defined for performance history to capture direct control data.

Control elements are identified within control systems using _IfcRelAssociatesClassification_ to indicate URLs of gateways and addresses of devices and data points.

To support multiple lifecycle stages, realtime control data (_IfcPerformanceHistory_) and design data (_IfcDistributionElement_ subtypes) are separate such that each may be used independently without the existence of the other, however both may be related via _IfcRelAssignsToControl_. If device addressing is known at the time of design where classification is applied to occurrence entities, then upon connecting to a control system the control element occurrences can be assigned to realtime device data (_IfcPerformanceHistory_) automatically according to matching classification.

To connect control elements to physical flow elements measured or controlled, the _IfcRelFlowControlElements_ relationship is used. For example, such relationship may map an actuator to a damper, or a temperature sensor to an evaporator coil. Performance data for _IfcDistributionFlowElement_ entities may be derived by traversing such relationships.

The _IfcBuildingControlsDomain_ schema does not specify building automation protocols, but may be mapped to standard protocols or vendor implementations for commissioning and operations interoperability. Common applicable entities are described as follows:

* _IfcPerformanceHistory_: Captures realtime device data in the form of property sets.
* _IfcPropertySet_: Captures a set of realtime device data, either using predefined data structures or custom information.
* _IfcPropertySetTemplate_: Captures metadata about custom properties, such as names, descriptions, data types, units, and ranges.
* _IfcRelAssociatesClassification_: Associates addresses of devices and control points to uniquely identify within a control system.
* _IfcController_: Captures non-realtime occurrence information for hardware or software-based arbitrary analog and digital data.
* _IfcAlarm_: Captures non-realtime occurrence information for hardware or software-based alarm sources.
* _IfcEvent_: Captures alarm event handling information.
* _IfcProcedure_: Captures device procedures that may be run arbitrarily or in response to events.
* _IfcTask_: Captures device programs that may be scheduled at various times.

Occurrences of _IfcConstructionEquipmentResource_ are products that are used as resources to assist the process of construction. More specifically, they are products that are standalone items brought to a project to fulfil a particular purpose. Examples might be a tower crane or other mobile crane, a screwing machine, or a lifting hoist.

Instances of any subtype of _IfcProduct_ may be assigned to the equipment resource using _IfcRelAssignsToResource_ in order to characterize the equipment further, as described at the supertype _IfcResource_.

Occurrences of _IfcConstructionMaterialResource_ are consumed (wholly or partially), or occupied during a construction work task (_IfcTask_).

Similar to _IfcConstructionProductResource_, sometimes things such as 5000kg of gravel are already instantiated as an instance of an _IfcProduct_ subtype because it is a result of a work task (for example, ‘transporting gravel’). In this case, the instance of _IfcConstructionMaterialResource_ can be associated with the product instance ‘5000kg of gravel’ to provide more information for resource uses. Nevertheless, _IfcConstructionMaterialResource_ should only be used to represent resource usage, but not product substances.

# IfcConstructionResource

_IfcConstructionResource_ is an abstract generalization of the different resources used in construction projects, mainly labour, material, equipment and product resources, plus subcontracted resources and aggregations such as a crew resource.
<!-- end of short definition -->

A resource represents "use of something" and does not necessarily correspond to a single item such as a person or vehicle, but represents a pool of items having limited availability such as general labor or an equipment fleet. A resource can represent either a generic resource pool (not having any task assignment) or a task-specific resource allocation (having an _IfcTask_ assignment).

> HISTORY New entity in IFC2x2.

{ .use-head}
### Declaration use definition

A root-level resource (specifically _IfcCrewResource_ or _IfcSubContractResource_) is declared within the project by _IfcRelDeclares_ where _RelatingContext_ refers to the single _IfcProject_ and _RelatedObjects_ refers to one or more _IfcConstructionResource_, and other root-level objects within the project.

{ .use-head}
### Assignment use definition

A resource may be assigned to an actor by _IfcRelAssignsToActor_ where _RelatingActor_ refers to an _IfcActor_ and _RelatedObjects_ refers to one or more _IfcConstructionResource_ or other objects. Such relationship indicates the actor responsible for allocating the resource such as partitioning into task-specific allocations, delegating to other actors, and/or scheduling over time. Note that this assignment does not indicate the person or organization performing the work; that is indicated by _IfcRelAssignsToResource_. The actor responsible for the resource may or may not be the same as any actor(s) performing work.

A resource may be assigned to a control by _IfcRelAssignsToControl_ where _RelatingControl_ refers to an _IfcControl_ and _RelatedObjects_ refers to one or more _IfcConstructionResource_ or other objects. Most commonly an _IfcWorkCalendar_ is assigned indicating availability of the resource, where such calendar is nested within a base calendar or an _IfcWorkPlan_ which in turn is assigned to the _IfcProject_.

A resource may be assigned to a group by _IfcRelAssignsToGroup_ where _RelatingGroup_ refers to an _IfcGroup_ and _RelatedObjects_ refers to one or more _IfcConstructionResource_ or other objects. Most commonly an _IfcAsset_ is assigned indicating the asset to be tracked, where such asset is nested within an _IfcInventory_ which in turn is assigned to the _IfcProject_.

A resource may be assigned to a product by _IfcRelAssignsToProduct_ where _RelatingProduct_ refers to an _IfcProduct_ and _RelatedObjects_ refers to one or more _IfcConstructionResource_ or other objects. Most commonly an _IfcElement_ subtype is assigned indicating the product to be constructed, where such product is connected to a spatial structure which in turn is aggregated within the _IfcProject_.

A resource may be assigned to a process by _IfcRelAssignsToProcess_ where _RelatingProcess_ refers to an _IfcProcess_ and _RelatedObjects_ refers to one or more _IfcConstructionResource_ or other objects. Most commonly an _IfcTask_ is assigned indicating the task to be performed by the resource, where such task is nested within a summary task which in turn is assigned to the _IfcProject_.

A resource may have assignments of other objects using _IfcRelAssignsToResource_ where _RelatingResource_ refers to the _IfcConstructionResource_ and _RelatedObjects_ refers to one or more objects such as _IfcActor_ or _IfcProduct_ subtypes. This relationship indicates specific objects assigned to fulfill resource usage.

Figure 1 illustrates resource assignment.

### Baseline use definition

A resource may have any number of baselines defined using the relationship _IfcRelDefinesByObject_ where _RelatingObject_ is the "current" resource and _RelatedObjects_ consists of multiple "baseline" resources, each representing a copy of the resource as it existed at an earlier point in time as shown in Figure 185. Each baseline _IfcConstructionResource_ is identified by its nested _IfcRelAssignsToControl_ relationship to an _IfcWorkSchedule_ having _PredefinedType=BASELINE_, _IfcWorkSchedule.CreationDate_ indicating the date of the baseline, and _IfcWorkSchedule.Name_ indicating the name of the baseline.

## Attributes

### Usage
Indicates the work, usage, and times scheduled and completed. Some attributes on this object may have associated constraints or time series; see documentation of _IfcResourceTime_ for specific usage. If the resource is nested, then certain values may be calculated based on the component resources as indicated at _IfcResourceTime_.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE New attribute.

### BaseCosts
Indicates the unit costs for which accrued amounts should be calculated. Such unit costs may be split into _Name_ designations (for example, 'Standard', 'Overtime'), and may contain a hierarchy of cost values that apply at different dates (using _IfcCostValue.ApplicableDate_ and _IfcCostValue.FixedUntilDate_).

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE New attribute.

### BaseQuantity
Identifies the base quantity consumed of the resource relative to assignments.

For crew, labour, subcontract, and equipment resources, this refers to _IfcQuantityTime_.

For material resources, this refers to any valid dimensional quantity, such as IfcQuantityVolume, IfcQuantityArea, IfcQuantityLength, or IfcQuantityWeight.

For product resources, this refers to _IfcQuantityCount_.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE New attribute.

## Concepts

### Constraint Association

Constraints may be applied to a resource to indicate fixed work (such as total person-hours) or fixed usage (such as simultaneous workers).

Figure FIXEDUSAGE indicates fixed usage (such as simultaneous workers) such that changes to ScheduleWork should impact the assigned IfcTask.TaskTime.ScheduleDuration and vice-versa.

### Document Association

Documents may be published for work plans consisting of schedules, calendars, tasks, and resources. The relationship IfcRelAssociatesDocument may be used to preserve mappings to such document where RelatingDocument points to an IfcDocumentReference and RelatedObjects includes the IfcConstructionResource as shown in Figure 184. _IfcDocumentReference.ItemReference_ identifies the resource within the scope of the document, such as an integer or guid. The _IfcDocumentReference.ReferencedDocument_ corresponds to the document which is uniquely identified by _IfcDocumentInformation.DocumentId_ and/or _IfcDocumentInformation.PublicationLocation_. Such document mapping allows items in the document to be updated from the building information model and vice-versa.

![Document Use Definition](../../../../figures/ifcconstructionresource-document.png "Figure 184 — Construction resource document use")

### Object Nesting

Resources may be decomposed into allocation pools using the IfcRelNests relationship as shown in Figure 181. For example, an IfcLaborResource for "Electrician" may be decomposed into three task-specific IfcLaborResource objects: "Electrical Rough-in", "First Floor Circuits", and "Second Floor Circuits". Both relating and related sides may represent the same _ResourceTime.ScheduleUsage_ quantity (for example, 6 workers time-shared), or the related side may break out _ResourceTime.ScheduleUsage_ quantities for reserved use (for example, 4 workers and 2 workers).

A common scenario is two nesting levels where the first-level resources have no task assignments; while second-level resources have specific task assignments indicating that the resource is subdivided into allocations for specific tasks. While the model allows unlimited nesting of resources, implementer agreements may restrict to two nesting levels with task assignments specifically at the second level.

![Composition Use Definition](../../../../figures/ifcconstructionresource-composition.png "Figure 181 — Construction resource composition use")

### Object Typing

The resource type may provide shared productivity and cost information, allowing tasks and resources to be selected according to lowest cost and/or shortest duration. Given an IfcProduct of a particular IfcTypeProduct type, an IfcTypeProcess may be selected from those assigned to the product type using IfcRelAssignsToProduct, and an IfcTypeResource may be selected from those assigned to the process type using IfcRelAssignsToProcess. Then IfcTask and IfcConstructionResource occurrences may be instantiated from the type definitions, applying productivitity and rate information to assigned quantities to calculate _ResourceTime.ScheduleWork_. Task durations can then be calculated by dividing _ResourceTime.ScheduleWork_ by _ResourceTime.ScheduleUsage_.

![Type Use Definition](../../../../figures/ifcconstructionresource-type.png "Figure 182 — Construction resource type use")

### Property Sets for Objects

For time series properties as shown in Figure 180, each IfcTimeSeriesValue indicates a LIST of values, where the sequence of the value corresponds to the IfcCostValue at _IfcConstructionResource.CostRatesConsumed_. For example, if CostRatesConsumed has two IfcCostValue items in the LIST, "Standard" and "Overtime", then _IfcTimeSeriesValue(IfcDuration('T8H0M0S'),IfcDuration('T2H0M0S'))_ would indicate 8 hours at Standard rate and 2 hours at Overtime rate. If the list of values at _IfcTimeSeriesValue.ListValues_ is less than the size of CostRatesConsumed, then subsequent values are considered to be zero.

# IfcConstructionResourceType

_IfcConstructionResourceType_ is an abstract generalization of the different resource types used in construction projects, mainly labor, material, equipment and product resource types, plus subcontracted resource types and aggregations such as a crew resource type.
<!-- end of short definition -->

A resource type represents a model of "use of something" and does not necessarily correspond to a specific type of object such as a person or vehicle, but represents possible usages of such objects such as general labor or an equipment fleet. A resource type can either represent usage in general (consumption attributes defined but no task type assignment) or a task-specific resource type (production attributes defined and having an _IfcTask_ assignment).

A construction resource type captures common productivities and cost rates for applying resources to particular task types.

> HISTORY New entity in IFC4.

{ .use-head}
Composition use definition

Resource types may be decomposed into nested resource types indicating productivities when applying the resource to specific task types using the _IfcRelNests_ relationship where _IfcRelNests.RelatingObject_ refers to the general resource type and _IfcRelNests.RelatedObjects_ refers to one or more task-specific productivities. For example, an _IfcLaborResourceType_ may be defined for "Carpenter" which may have a nested _IfcLaborResourceType_ for "Carpenter - Wall Framing" and another nested _IfcLaborResourceType_ for "Carpenter - Drywall", each of which may have productivities based according to specific task types (_IfcTaskType_).

{ .use-head}
Assignment use definition

Resource types may be assigned to process types (_IfcTypeProcess_ subtypes) using the _IfcRelAssignsToProcess_ relationship as shown in Figure 1. Such relationship indicates that the resource type applies to the process type for the use indicated (e.g. _IfcTaskType.PredefinedType_). Such relationship enables a scenario of placing an _IfcProduct_ of a particular _IfcTypeProduct_, querying for a set of _IfcTypeProcess_ process types for constructing such product (e.g. _IfcTaskTypeEnum.CONSTRUCTION_), querying each _IfcTypeProcess_ for a set of _IfcTypeResource_ resource types for carrying out the process, and finally choosing an _IfcTypeProcess_ and _IfcTypeResource_ combination resulting in the shortest time for instantiated _IfcTask_ occurrence(s) and/or lowest-cost for instantiated _IfcConstructionResource_ occurrence(s).

![Assignment Use Definition](../../../../figures/ifcconstructionresourcetype-assignment.png "Figure 1 — Construction resource type assignment")

## Attributes

### BaseCosts
Indicates the unit costs and environmental impacts for which accrued amounts should be calculated. Such unit costs may be split into _Name_ designations (e.g. 'Standard', 'Overtime'), and may contain a hierarchy of cost values that apply at different dates (using _IfcCostValue.ApplicableDate_ and _IfcCostValue.FixedUntilDate_).

### BaseQuantity
Identifies the quantity for which the _BaseQuantityProduced_ applies. The _Name_ of the _IfcPhysicalQuantity_ identifies the quantity definition being measured, e.g. "GrossVolume". For production-based resources (e.g. carpentry labor), this value refers to quantities on _IfcProduct_(s) to which the assigned _IfcTask_ is assigned. For duration-based resources (e.g. safety inspector, fuel for equipment), this value refers to quantities that may be assigned to occurrences of the assigned _IfcTaskType_.

Identification of people and equipment of a crew is achieved through their specification at the level of the component. Therefore, knowing which persons are within a crew is achieved through identifying the persons assigned to each _IfcLaborResource_ within the _IfcCrewResource_. Similarly, identifying that a screwing machine for pipe fitting forms part of the crew is achieved by relating an appropriate instance of _IfcElementComponent_ to the _IfcConstructionEquipmentResource_ forming an element of the _IfcCrewResource_.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE The attribute _Skillset_ has been deleted; use LongDescription to describe the skillset.

The purpose of an _IfcLaborResource_ is to identify a skillset that may be required or used. The skillset identified may be (for instance) charge-hand, foreman, labourer, plumbers mate etc. and provides a designation of a particular level of skill. It can be used to identify the generic type of labour resource that is required for a purpose without having to be specific about the actor (person or organization) providing the resource occurrence. It may be particularly useful when creating an overall plan for a process or processes. For instance, within maintenance or work planning there may be a known task that needs to be done which is planned to require a 'chargehand pipe fitter'. There may be several such labour resources available and so the need to identify which will be used is not necessary at the planning stage.

At a later stage, individual actors can be determined for the labour resources. This is achieved through specifying the actor through _IfcActor_. The actor is then identified as the labour resource occurrence through the _IfcRelAssignsToResource.RelatedResource_ attribute. The _IfcLaborResource_ provides the _IfcRelAssignsToResource_._RelatingResource_ attribute.

IfcConstructionMgmtDomain
=========================

The _IfcConstructionMgmtDomain_ schema defines resource concepts in the construction management domain. Together with the _IfcProcessExtension_ and _IfcSharedMgmtElements_ schemas it provides a set of models that can be used to exchange information between construction management applications.

The _IfcConstructionMgmtDomain_ schema extends resources and resource types as applicable to construction. The objective of the _IfcConstructionMgmtDomain_ schema is to capture information that supports specific business processes and resource requirements that are wholly within the domain of interest of the Construction Manager. The aim is to provide support for information exchange and sharing within computer aided management applications.

The following are within the scope of this schema:

* resources used in the construction process including material, labour, equipment, product, crew, and sub-contract resources;
* identification of products that result from processes performed that are used as resources in future processes.
* resource productivity calculation to determine work, usage, and ultimately durations of tasks.
* resource time information to support allocations and levelling.
* resource cost information to support earned value calculations.
* resource quantities to support derived costs within cost schedules.
* time-phased data to indicate scheduled and actual work, usage, and costs at particular periods in time.
* resource type definitions describing shared productivity and cost rates that may be applied to resource occurrences.

A resource is the use of any physical or virtual entity of limited availability. A resource may be fulfilled by tangible objects such as particular people or equipment, however a resource does not represent such objects, but a particular use of such objects such as labour. Construction resources extend the concept of resources to include the quantities, costs, schedule, and other impacts from use in construction processes.

Construction management activities may take place either on a complete product (the whole), on a part of the product or on a set of products acting as a single product entity (complex). The product composition structure enabling parts, whole, and complexes to be identified is achieved using aggregation or nesting subtype of the _IfcRelDecomposes_ relationship class.

The **IfcSolarDeviceType** may be declared within _IfcProject_ or _IfcProjectLibrary_ using _IfcRelDeclares_ and may be exchanged with or without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of **IfcSolarDeviceType** are represented by instances of _IfcSolarDevice_. Refer to the documentation at _IfcSolarDevice_ for supported property sets, materials, composition, and ports.

## Attributes

### PredefinedType


## Formal Propositions

### CorrectPredefinedType
Either the _PredefinedType_ attribute is unset (e.g. because an _IfcSwitchingDeviceType_ is associated), or the inherited attribute _ObjectType_ shall be provided, if the _PredefinedType_ is set to USERDEFINED.

### CorrectTypeAssigned
Either there is no switching device type object associated, i.e. the _IsTypedBy_ inverse relationship is not provided, or the associated type object has to be of type _IfcSwitchingDeviceType_.

## Concepts

### Material Set



#### Casing

Material from which the casing is constructed.

#### Conductor

Material from which the conductors are constructed.

#### Surface

Material from which the switch surface is constructed.

### Object Typing



### Port Nesting



#### SINK_Line_ELECTRICAL

The supply line.

#### SOURCE_Load_ELECTRICAL

The load controlled by the switch.

### Property Sets for Objects

# IfcTransformer

A transformer is an inductive stationary device that transfers electrical energy from one circuit to another.
<!-- end of short definition -->

_IfcTransformer_ is used to transform electric power; conversion of electric signals for other purposes is handled at other entities: _IfcController_ converts arbitrary signals, _IfcAudioVisualAppliance_ converts signals for audio or video streams, and _IfcCommunicationsAppliance_ converts signals for data or other communications usage.

IfcElectricalDomain
===================

The _IfcElectricalDomain_ schema forms part of the Domain Layer of the IFC Model. It extends the ideas concerning building services outlined in the _IfcSharedBldgServiceElements_ schema. It defines concepts of cabled systems where the cabling carries electrical supply, data, telephone signals or other forms of cable transmission.

Additionally the schema defines various devices that are connected by cabling, protection of electrical devices, provision and concepts of light fixtures within buildings, the cabling itself and methods for supporting and carrying cables.

The scope of the _IfcElectricalDomain_ is defined as:

1. cabled systems for power distribution and lighting, data, telecommunications, security, signalling, control and audio visual purposes,
2. equipment that is used within such systems,
3. connection of equipment to circuits, distribution points etc,
4. steady state operation of electrical installations,
5. light fixtures (fittings), their types and the provision of such information as is necessary to enable lighting calculations that provide physically accurate illuminance.

Note that for electrical systems, the schema has the particular scope of low voltage electrical installations according to Volts (V) and Alternating Current (AC) or Direct Current (DC), from 12V (AC/DC) to 1000V (AC) or 1500V (DC) in accordance with ISO/IEC definitions where installations in scope are considered to commence at a meter where the public utility supply terminates or at a transformer where voltage is stepped down to the low voltage range in scope.

Other electrical systems including extra low, medium and high voltage may be specified using this schema but the provisions of such systems have not yet been specifically provided for.

Similarly, whilst the electrical domain schema may be used for data, telecommunications, security, signalling, control and audio visual purposes, the specific provisions required of these types of systems are not yet fully captured and elaborated within the model.

The _IfcElectricalDomain_ schema supports ideas including types of:

* audio-visual appliance,
* cable carrier fittings (for conduit, cable tray, cable duct and ladder),
* electrical appliance,
* electric motor,
* distribution panels,
* generator,
* junction box,
* light fixture,
* lamp,
* outlet,
* protective device,
* protective device tripping unit,
* switching device,
* transformer,

The following items are in scope but not elaborated:

* medium and high voltage installations over 1000V AC and 1500V DC
* systems with voltage of less than 12 volts (AC/DC)
* audio-visual systems
* telecommunications systems
* data systems
* cabling for signal and control systems
* cable routers (cable ladders)
* computer network cabling and devices used on networks

The following are deemed to be out of scope of the _IfcElectricalDomain_ schema at this time:

* public utility supply of electrical services
* non steady state/transient states of operation of electrical installations
* security arrangements associated with safety of electrical installations
* communication signals between automation devices or bus systems
* sensors (which are dealt with in the _IfcBuildingControlsDomain_ schema)
* spotlight mirror systems whereby a spotlight is directed towards a distant mirror that the distributes the light energy (other than as a group of separately defined objects)
* lighting for specialist purposes (for example, stage, painting)

An electrical circuit is formed from electrical devices connected together with power carrying cables. Up to IFC4, an instance of an electrical circuit has been defined as an _IfcElectricalCircuit_ (subtype of _IfcSystem_). This is now deleted as of IFC4. Instead, electrical systems together with other cable systems and other forms of distribution system are now identified through the _IfcDistributionSystem.PredefinedType::IfcDistributionSystemEnum_, along with specific property sets.

# IfcCoil

A coil is a device used to provide heat transfer between non-mixing media. A common example is a cooling coil, which utilizes a finned coil in which circulates chilled water, antifreeze, or refrigerant that is used to remove heat from air moving across the surface of the coil. A coil may be used either for heating or cooling purposes by placing a series of tubes (the coil) carrying a heating or cooling fluid into an airstream. The coil may be constructed from tubes bundled in a serpentine form or from finned tubes that give a extended heat transfer surface.

A cooled beam (or chilled beam) is a device typically used to cool air by circulating a fluid such as chilled water through exposed finned tubes above a space. Typically mounted overhead near or within a ceiling, the cooled beam uses convection to cool the space below it by acting as a heat sink for the naturally rising warm air of the space. Once cooled, the air naturally drops back to the floor where the cycle begins again.

IfcHvacDomain
=============

The _IfcHvacDomain_ schema defines basic object concepts required for interoperability within the heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) domain. It extends concepts defined in the _IfcSharedBldgServiceElements_ schema.

The scope of the _IfcHvacDomain_ schema is defined as:

1. The segments, fittings and connections that constitute duct and piping distribution systems typically used for building services, such as for air conditioning, ventilation and exhaust-air systems; chilled water, steam and heating hot water, potable water, waste, natural gas and LPG systems, etc.
2. Equipment typically used in building services systems, such as boilers, chillers, fans, and pumps and the vibration isolation associated with these components.
3. Terminal and flow control devices, such as air vents and grilles, variable air volume modulators, valves, and dampers.

The following are deemed to be out of scope of the _IfcHvacDomain_ schema at this time:

* Industrial and institutional specialty equipment such as that used for power production, manufacturing and fabrication, etc.
* Provisions for dealing explicitly with hazardous materials such as chemical or biological agents
* Controls systems and sequencing systems for these equipment beyond what is defined in the _IfcBuildingControlsDomain_ schema

> HISTORY  This schema has been significantly modified in IFC2x2.

## Items

### BASIN
An arbitrary open tank type.

### BREAKPRESSURE
An open container that breaks the hydraulic pressure in a distribution system, typically located between the fluid reservoir and the fluid supply points. A typical break pressure tank allows the flow to discharge into the atmosphere, thereby reducing its hydrostatic pressure to zero.

### EXPANSION
A closed container used in a closed fluid distribution system to mitigate the effects of thermal expansion or water hammer. The tank is typically constructed with a diaphragm dividing the tank into two sections, with fluid on one side of the diaphragm and air on the other. One example application is when connected to the primary circuit of a hot water system to accommodate the increase in volume of the water when it is heated.

### FEEDANDEXPANSION
An open tank that is used for both storage and thermal expansion. A typical example is a tank used to store make-up water at ambient pressure for supply to a hot water system, simultaneously accommodating increases in volume of the water when heated.

### PRESSUREVESSEL
A closed container used for storing fluids or gases at a pressure different from the ambient pressure. A pressure vessel is typically rated by an authority having jurisdiction for the operational pressure.

### STORAGE
An open or closed container used for storing a fluid at ambient pressure and from which it can be supplied to the fluid distribution system. There are many examples of storage tanks, such as potable water storage tanks, fuel storage tanks, etc.

### VESSEL
An arbitrary closed tank type.

IfcPlumbingFireProtectionDomain
===============================

The _IfcPlumbingFireProtectionDomain_ schema forms part of the Domain Layer of the IFC Model. It extends the ideas concerning building services outlined in the _IfcSharedBldgServiceElements_ schema. It defines concepts in the domain of plumbing and fire protection.

The scope of the _IfcPlumbingFireProtectionDomain_, in conjunction with other building services related schemata, is the provision of plumbing and fire protection services to buildings.

In the case of plumbing, the scope includes for the provision of services external to the building up to the final manhole at which connection is made to the public drainage/sewage service provision. Particular exceptions to support building code checking requirements are made as outlined below.

In the case of fire protection, the scope includes for all services from the point at which a fire authority service is connected or the point at which the statutory water provider terminates the public connection.

In particular, _IfcPlumbingFireProtectionDomain_ schema supports ideas including types of:

* sanitary element concerned with personal and public hygiene,
* trap on waste pipelines to prevent backflow and odor transmission,
* interceptor to capture unwanted liquid and solid waste materials and prevent their passage into drainage pipelines,
* waste disposal unit,
* cowl terminating ventilation and rainwater pipes at their highest elevation,
* automatic and manual terminal point that can be activated to extinguish fire,
* hydrant that provide a source of water for hoses in the event of fire or other need for a temporary water supply.

The following are deemed to be out of scope of the _IfcPlumbingFireProtectionDomain_ schema at this time:

* public utility water and waste services

The element type _IfcTrackElementType_ defines commonly shared information for occurrences of track elements. The set of shared information may include:
* common properties within shared property sets
* common material information
* common profile definitions
* common shape representations
<!-- end of short definition -->

It is used to define a track element specification (the specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that track element type). Track element types may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.
Occurrences of the _IfcTrackElementType_ are represented by instances of _IfcTrackElement_.

## Attributes

IfcRailDomain
=============

The _IfcRailDomain_ schema defines specific object concepts used in the rail domain that have not been covered in lower level schemas or schemas in the same level.

> NOTE  Most elements used in the rail domain are shared with other domains and are consequently declared in lower level schemas or schemas in the same level, such as _IfcProductExtension_, _IfcSharedInfrastructureElements_, _IfcSharedBldgElements_, _IfcSharedBldgServiceElements_, or _IfcElectricalDomain_.

Specific rail elements that are not already covered by other schemas are defined here:

* different types of rails for ensuring guidance of moving for vehicles or other kinds of machineries.
* specific elements used in the track sub-domain, e.g. sleeper, frog, derailer, etc.
* spatial structure types for breaking down railway projects.

<!-- end of short definition -->

## Items

### RACKRAIL
A rack rail is a building module for enhancing traction and break performance.

### BLADE
A blade is a machined rail, often of special section, but fixed and/or joined at the heel end to a rail to provide continuity of wheel support. The two switch rails in a set are the two inside rails. A switch rail is described as right or left hand according to whether it is part of a right hand or left hand half-set of switches.
Note: definition from EN 13232-1-2004.

### GUARDRAIL
A guard rail is a rail that limits risk of train derailment, normally not loaded.

### STOCKRAIL
A stock rail is a fixed machined rail, ensuring the continuity on the main or diverging track with the switch in the open position. The machined part of the stock rail supports its switch rail in the closed position, giving continuity of line through this switch rail. The two stock rails in a set of switches are the two outside rails. A stock rail is described as right or left hand according to whether it is part of a right hand or left hand half-set of switches.
Note: definition from EN 13232-1-2004.

### CHECKRAIL
A check rail is a rail laid close to the gauge face of a running rail which takes part in lateral guidance of the wheel and prevents derailment in small radius curved track and switches and crossings.
Note: definition from EN 13481-1.

### RAIL
A rail is a special section bar (usually of steel) ensuring the guidance of the wheel of a rolling stock or other heavy machineries. In railway, two rails are combined to form a track.

### USERDEFINED

# IfcRailwayPartTypeEnum

The _IfcRailwayPartTypeEnum_ defines the range of different types of railway part that can be specified.
<!-- end of short definition -->

A railway line can be spatially organised into several parts, using a vertical, longitudinal and lateral criteria for its division. There is not one standardised way of spatially dividing the line, as this depends on the use case. The _IfcRailwayPart_s that can be used to spatially organise a line are:

- **Track**, which can be further described by
  - Plain tracks
  - Turnout tracks
  - Dilatation tracks
  - Or other track parts
- **Line-side**, which can be further described by
  - Line-side parts
- **Substructure** (for constructed ground)
- **Above-track**

See descriptions of enumeration types for further details. Below are some suggestions on how parts can be used to spatially organise a railway line.

**Vertical organisation**

![Railway part vertical organisation](../../../../figures/IfcRailwayPartTypeEnum-global.png)

Figure 1 — Example of usage of _IfcRailwayPart_ to vertically organise the elements of a railway line

> NOTE If required by the use case, the part below the track can be distinguished between _IfcRailwayPart.SUBSTRUCTURE_ (for constructed ground) and _IfcFacilityPartCommon.BELOWGROUND_ (for non constructed, existing ground).

> NOTE The Figure above covers the average simple case. For example, other advanced cases could be:
> * Railway line on a bridge
> * Railway line in a tunnel (single or multiple tubes)
> * Railway line junction (two or more lines crossing)
> * Railway line in the context of a main station building
> * Railway line with its supporting radio communication equipment (e.g. GSM-R equipment, antenna poles) on a nearby hill
> 
> Such more advanced cases might require a specific spatial organisation.

**Detailed vertical organisation**
If required by the use case, the *SUBSTRUCTURE* part can contain elements such as _IfcCourse_ or _IfcEarthworksFill_ to distinguish the different substructure layers. An example is captured in the Figure below.

![Railway part detailed vertical organisation](../../../../figures/IfcRailwayPartTypeEnum-substructure.png)

Figure 2 — Example of the courses and elements that may be contained in the *SUBSTRUCTURE* part 

**Longitudinal organisation**

Tracks may also have a longitudinal organisation based on track specificities:

* PLAINTRACK for the plain line tracks.
* TURNOUTTRACK for the area of turnouts.

As depicted in the example Figure below. Other parts, not included in the example, may be:
* DILATATIONTRACK for the area of dilatation panels.
* TRACKPART for generic-purpose longitudinal organisation of parts of the track.

![Railway part longitudinal organisation](../../../../figures/IfcRailwayPartTypeEnum-track.png)

Figure 3 — Example of _IfcRailwayPart_ to longitudinally organise the elements of a railway line

**Mixed organisation**
The attribute _IfcFacilityPart.UsageType_ allows to to spatially organise the same dataset using multiple criteria. For example, a general vertical organisation, like in Figure 1, and a further longitudinal organisation just for the track, as in Figure 2. 

> NOTE This creates an implicit hierarchy among spatial parts and increases the complexity of the model.

## Items

### TRACK
A spatial structure element that contains track-related elements, for example rails and sleepers.

### PLAINTRACK
A spatial structure element to further divide a track. It does do not contain any turnout panel or dilatation panel.

### TURNOUTTRACK
A spatial structure element to further divide a track. It contains turnouts, and does not contain any plain track or dilatation panel.

### DILATATIONTRACK
A spatial structure element to further divide a track. It may be used in specific points of the line, where expansions or movements of tracks need to be accommodated (e.g., before and after a bridge). It does not contain any plain-track or turnout panel.

### TRACKPART
A spatial structure element to further divide a track, for purposes that do not fall into these categories: plain-track, turnout-track, dilatation-track.

### LINESIDE
A spatial structure element that contains elements of the railway that are not in or over the tracks, hence line-side.

### LINESIDEPART
A spatial structure element to further divide a line-side part. It can be used to distinguish line-side parts into more manageable volumes, for engineering purposes.

### ABOVETRACK
A spatial structure element that contains elements that are positioned above or over the track, for example catenary lines and suspension systems.

### SUBSTRUCTURE
A spatial structure element that contains elements that are positioned below the track, for example the earthwork platform, prepared subgrade and embankment. This can be above or below finished ground level.

**Use Definition**

_Point Connection_
Instances of the entity _IfcRelConnectsStructuralMember_ shall be used to describe a connection between an instance of _IfcStructuralPointConnection_ and either an instance of _IfcStructuralCurveMember_ or _IfcStructuralSurfaceMember_. The _RelatedStructuralConnection_ for point connections has to be of type _IfcStructuralPointConnection_.

_Curve Connection_

_Coordinate System for Applied Conditions_
All values defined by _AppliedCondition_ or _AdditionalConditions_ are given within the coordinate system provided by _ConditionCoordinateSystem_, which is defined relative to the local coordinate system of the structural member. If the _ConditionCoordinateSystem_ is not defined, the local coordinate system of the structural member is used instead.

_Supported Length_
Optionally a supported length can be given, which specifies the length (or width) of the physical connection along a curve connection.

{ .use-head}
Relationship use definition

Structural actions are grouped into either an _IfcStructuralLoadGroup_ of predefined type LOAD_GROUP or, more often, an _IfcStructuralLoadCase_. This is accomplished via the inverse relationship _HasAssignments_ and an _IfcRelAssignsToGroup_ relationship object. _IfcStructuralLoadGroup.LoadGroupFor_ or _IfcStructuralLoadCase.LoadGroupFor_ respectively refers to the structural analysis model(s) in which the loads are used.

It is furthermore possible to establish relationships between actions in one analysis model and reactions in another analysis model which cause the actions. For example, a support reaction from one structural system may be taken over as a load onto another supporting structural system. This is expressed by means of the inverse relationship _ReferencedBy_ of the action and an _IfcRelAssignsToProduct_ relationship object. _IfcRelAssignsToProduct.Name_ is set to 'Causes' and _IfcRelAssignsToProduct.RelatedObjects_ refers to an instance of a subtype of _IfcStructuralReaction_.

## Attributes

### DestabilizingLoad
Indicates if this action may cause a stability problem. If it is 'FALSE', no further investigations regarding stability problems are necessary.

# IfcStructuralActivity

The abstract entity _IfcStructuralActivity_ combines the definition of actions (such as forces, displacements, etc.) and reactions (support reactions, internal forces, deflections, etc.) which are specified by using the basic load definitions from the _IfcStructuralLoadResource_.
<!-- end of short definition -->

The differentiation between actions and reactions is realized by instantiating objects either from subclasses of _IfcStructuralAction_ or _IfcStructuralReaction_ respectively. They inherit commonly needed attributes from the abstract superclass _IfcStructuralActivity_, notably the relationship which connects actions or reactions with connections, analysis members, or elements (subtypes of _IfcStructuralItem_ or _IfcElement_).

> NOTE Instances of _IfcStructuralActivity_ which are connected with an _IfcElement_ are subject to agreements outside the scope of this specification.

> NOTE The semantics of _IfcStructuralActivity_ are only fully defined if an activity instance is connected with exactly one structural item. The inverse attribute _AssignedToStructuralItem_ can only be empty in incomplete models or in conceptual models which are not yet ready for analysis.

> HISTORY New entity in IFC2x2.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE Cardinality of attribute _AssignedToStructuralItem_ relaxed from 1 to 0..1 in order to allow for schema-compliant incomplete models as well as conceptual models without load—item relationships.

****Coordinate Systems****:

The following coordinate systems are distinguished:

* The so-called global coordinate system is the coordinate system shared by all items and activities which are grouped in a common _IfcStructuralAnalysisModel_. This coordinate system is established by an _ObjectPlacement_. (This coordinate system is not necessarily the same as the _IfcProject_'s world coordinate system.)
* The so-called local coordinate system is a coordinate system local to a structural item (connection or member). This coordinate system is established by a _Representation_ in conjunction with further use definitions and attributes of subtypes of _IfcStructuralItem_.

Representation items in topology representations are always given within the _ObjectPlacement_, i.e. in so-called global coordinates (global with respect to the _IfcStructuralAnalysisModel_ to which this activity belongs).

Locations of the load objects in the _AppliedLoad_ attribute (if of type _IfcStructuralLoadConfiguration_) are always given in local coordinates.

Directions of the load objects in the _AppliedLoad_ attribute refer to global or local coordinates according to the _GlobalOrLocal_ attribute.

The _ObjectPlacement_ and _Representation_ are sometimes not explicitly instantiated; instead they may be implied as described below. Global and local coordinate systems are then determined in the same way as with explicit placement and representation.

****Topology Use Definitions****:

Instances of _IfcStructuralActivity_ which are connected with a structural item of same dimensionality, i.e.

* a point action or reaction connected with a point item (_IfcStructuralPointConnection_),
* a curve action or reaction connected with a curve item (_IfcStructuralCurveConnection_, _IfcStructuralCurveMember_), or
* a surface action or reaction connected with a surface item (_IfcStructuralSurfaceConnection_, _IfcStructuralSurfaceMember_) and which acts on the entire surface of the item and is not specified by isocontours

shall not have an _ObjectPlacement_ nor a _Representation_. It is implied that the placement and representation of the _IfcStructuralActivity_ is the same as the ones of the _IfcStructuralItem_.

Instances of _IfcStructuralActivity_ which are connected with

* a curve item (_IfcStructuralCurveConnection_, _IfcStructuralCurveMember_) and act on a point of the item
* a surface item (_IfcStructuralSurfaceConnection_, _IfcStructuralSurfaceMember_) and act on a point or on a curve or on a part of the surface of the item

shall have a topology representation as specified below. It includes a placement and a product representation. The _IfcProductRepresentation_ shall be given by an item in a _Representation_ of type _IfcTopologyRepresentation_.

Instances of _IfcStructuralActivity_ which are connected with

* a surface item (_IfcStructuralSurfaceConnection_, _IfcStructuralSurfaceMember_) and are specified by isocontours

shall have a shape representation as specified below. It includes a placement and a product representation. The _IfcProductRepresentation_ shall be given by items in a _Representation_ of type _IfcShapeRepresentation_. Shape representation and topology representation may be combined.

**Local Placement**

The local placement for _IfcStructuralActivity_ is defined in its supertype _IfcProduct_. It is defined by the _IfcLocalPlacement_, which establishes a global coordinate system which shall be common to all items and activities in an _IfcStructuralAnalysisModel_.

**Topology Representation**

Instances of _IfcStructuralActivity_ which act on parts of a surface item shall have a topology representation given by a face with underlying surface geometry, _IfcFaceSurface_, which should be the single item of _IfcTopologyRepresentation.Items_. The surface establishes a local coordinate system of the activity:

* The origin of surface parameters u,v is the origin of the local coordinate system.
* The local x and y directions follow the tangents on the surface and are in parallel with and directed like u and v respectively.
* The local z direction is in parallel with and directed like the surface normal.

> * _RepresentationIdentifier_: 'Reference'
> * _RepresentationType_: 'Face'

Instances of _IfcStructuralActivity_ which act on a curve on a surface item shall have a topology representation given by an edge (_IfcEdge_ or subtype), which should be the single item of _IfcTopologyRepresentation.Items_. The curve geometry shall be compatible with the surface geometry of the connected item. In conjunction with this surface, the curve establishes a local coordinate system of the activity:

* The origin of the curve parameter u is the origin of the local coordinate system.
* The local x direction follows the tangent on the curve and is directed like u.
* The local z direction is in parallel with and directed like the surface normal of the connected surface item.
* The local x,y,z directions form a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system.

> * _RepresentationIdentifier_: 'Reference'
> * _RepresentationType_: 'Edge'

> NOTE While an _IfcEdge_ (or _IfcOrientedEdge_ with underlying _IfcEdge_) does not provide an explicit underlying curve geometry, it may be used to imply an underlying straight line as reference curve with the origin of the curve parameter at the start vertex point.

Instances of _IfcStructuralActivity_ which act on a single point on a curve or surface item shall have a topology representation given by an _IfcVertexPoint_, which should be the single item of _IfcTopologyRepresentation.Items_. The point geometry shall be compatible with the curve or surface geometry of the connected item. The local coordinate system of the activity is oriented by the curve or surface geometry of the connected item as described above for activities with edge or face topology.

> * _RepresentationIdentifier_: 'Reference'
> * _RepresentationType_: 'Vertex'

**Shape Representation**

Instances of _IfcStructuralActivity_ which act on a surface item and are specified by isocontours (level sets) shall have a shape representation given by a set of curves on a surface, _IfcPcurve_. The basis surface shall comply with or preferably be identical with the surface of the structural item to which the activity is connected. The representation identifier and type of this geometric representation is:

> * _RepresentationIdentifier_: 'Level set'
> * _RepresentationType_: 'GeometricCurveSet'

## Attributes

### AppliedLoad
Load or result resource object which defines the load type, direction, and load values.

In case of activities which are variably distributed over curves or surfaces, _IfcStructuralLoadConfiguration_ is used which provides a list of load samples and their locations within the load distribution, measured in local coordinates of the curve or surface on which this activity acts. The contents of this load or result distribution may be further restricted by definitions at subtypes of _IfcStructuralActivity_.

### GlobalOrLocal
Indicates whether the load directions refer to the global coordinate system (global to
the analysis model, i.e. as established by _IfcStructuralAnalysisModel.SharedPlacement_)
or to the local coordinate system (local to the activity or connected item, as established by
an explicit or implied representation and its parameter space).

> NOTE , the informal definition of _IfcRepresentationResource.IfcGlobalOrLocalEnum_ doe s not distinguish between "global coordinate system" and "world coordinate system". On the other hand, this distinction is necessary in the _IfcStructuralAnalysisDomain_ where the shared "global" coordinate system of an analysis model may very well not be the same as the project-wide world coordinate system.

> NOTE In the scope of _IfcStructuralActivity.GlobalOrLocal_, the meaning of GLOBAL_COORDS is therefore not to be taken as world coordinate system but as the analysis model specific shared coordinate system. In contrast, LOCAL_COORDS is to be taken as coordinates which are local to individual structural items and activities, as established by subclass-specific geometry use definitions.

### AssignedToStructuralItem
Reference to the _IfcRelConnectsStructuralActivity_ relationship by which activities are connected with structural items.

# IfcStructuralAnalysisModel

The _IfcStructuralAnalysisModel_ is used to assemble all information needed to represent a structural analysis model. It encompasses certain general properties (such as analysis type), references to all contained structural members, structural supports or connections, as well as loads and the respective load results.
<!-- end of short definition -->

Important functionalities for the description of an analysis model are derived from existing IFC entities:

* From _IfcSystem_ it inherits the ability to couple the built system via _IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure_ to one or more _IfcSpatialElement_ subtypes as necessary.

* From _IfcGroup_ it inherits the inverse attribute IsGroupedBy, pointing to the relationship class _IfcRelAssignsToGroup_ . This allows the grouping of structural members (instances of _IfcStructuralMember_), and supports (instances of _IfcStructuralConnection_ which belong to a specific analysis model.

>> NOTE Loads (as instances of _IfcStructuralAction_ are not included through IsGroupedBy. Loads are assigned through the LoadedBy attribute relationship, using load groups as a grouping mechanism. Only top-level load groups should be referenced via LoadedBy, i.e. load combinations if any load combinations exist, or load cases if no load combinations exist in this analysis model.

>> NOTE Results (as instances of _IfcStructuralReaction_ are not included through IsGroupedBy. Results are assigned through the HasResults attribute relationship, using result groups as a grouping mechanism.

* From _IfcObjectDefinition_ it inherits the inverse attribute IsDecomposedBy pointing to the relationship class _IfcRelAggregates_. It provides the hierarchy between the separate (partial) analysis models.

> HISTORY New entity in IFC2x2.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE Attribute _SharedPlacement_ and informal propositions added, allowing for easy retrieval of the common object placement and for specification of the analysis model's coordinate system before any structural item is instantiated. WHERE rule added.

**Informal Propositions**

1. If one or more structural item (instance of a subtype of _IfcStructuralItem_ is grouped into an _IfcStructuralAnalysisModel_, the attribute SharedPlacement shall be provided with a value.
2. The _ObjectPlacement_ of all structural items which are grouped into the same instance of _IfcStructuralAnalysisModel_ shall refer to the same instance of _IfcObjectPlacement_ as _IfcStructuralAnalysisModel_.SharedPlacement.


> NOTE This rule is necessary to achieve consistent topology representations. The topology representations of structural items in an analysis model are meant to share vertices and edges und must therefore have the same object placement.

> NOTE A structural item may be grouped into more than one analysis model. In this case, all these models must use the same instance of _IfcObjectPlacement_.

****Coordinate Systems****:

See definitions at _IfcStructuralActivity_.

****Topology Use Definitions****:

Standard Case:
If connected with a curve item, instances of _IfcStructuralCurveAction_ shall not have an _ObjectPlacement_ nor a _Representation_. It is implied that the placement and representation of the _IfcStructuralActivity_ is the same as the ones of the member or connection.

Special Case 1:
If connected with a surface item, instances of _IfcStructuralCurveAction_ shall have an _ObjectPlacement_ and _Representation_, containing an _IfcEdgeCurve_. See _IfcStructuralActivity_ for further definitions.

Special Case 2:
If not connected with a structural item (which may happen in an incomplete or conceptual model), a curve action should have an _ObjectPlacement_ and _Representation_, containing an _IfcEdgeCurve_. See _IfcStructuralActivity_ for further definitions.

**Informal Propositions**

1. If the curve action is of the predefined type CONST, SINUS, or PARABOLA, _SELF\IfcStructuralActivity.AppliedLoad_ must not be of type _IfcStructuralLoadConfiguration_. In case of SINUS and PARABOLA, the load item defines the maximum of the load at the centre of the load distribution.
2. If the curve action is of the predefined type LINEAR, _SELF\IfcStructuralActivity.AppliedLoad_ shall be of type _IfcStructuralLoadConfiguration_ and shall contain two items.
3. If the curve action is of the predefined type POLYGONAL, _SELF\IfcStructuralActivity.AppliedLoad_ shall be of type _IfcStructuralLoadConfiguration_ and shall contain three or more items.
4. If the curve action is of the predefined type DISCRETE, _SELF\IfcStructuralActivity.AppliedLoad_ shall be of type _IfcStructuralLoadConfiguration_ and shall contain two or more items.
5. In case of types LINEAR, POLYGONAL, and DISCRETE, the load items shall have one-dimensional _IfcStructuralLoadConfiguration.Locations_, defining the location of the load samples in local coordinates of the curve action. The load items shall be provided in ascending order according to their locations. The first and the last load item define the extent of the load distribution.
6. Point actions must be of type DISCRETE, thus contain two or more load points. (Single point loads are modeled by _IfcStructuralPointAction_.)
7. All items in _SELF\IfcStructuralActivity.AppliedLoad\IfcStructuralLoadConfiguration.Values_ shall be of the same entity type.

### Material Profile Set Usage

The material of direct instances IfcStructuralCurveMember (in contrast to instances of the subtype IfcStructuralCurveMemberVarying) is defined by IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage and attached by the IfcRelAssociatesMaterial.RelatingMaterial. It is accessible by the inverse HasAssociations relationship. Composite profile beams can be represented by referring to several IfcMaterialProfiles within the IfcMaterialProfileSet that is referenced from the IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage. In case of tapered members, the material profile usage subtype IfcMaterialProfileSetUsageTapering is used which specifies IfcMaterialProfileSets separately at the start and the end of the tapered member.


The material (IfcMaterial) in each IfcMaterialProfile(Set) is specified minimally by a name which corresponds with an agreed upon standardized structural material designation. An external reference to the source which specifies the material designation should be provided. Alternatively, structural material properties may be provided using material property sets.


The profile (IfcProfileDef) in each IfcMaterialProfile(Set) is specified minimally by a name which corresponds with an agreed upon standardized structural profile designation. An external reference to the source which specifies the profile designation should be provided. Alternatively or additionally, explicit profile geometry should be provided by using respective subtypes of IfcProfileDef. Alternatively or additionally, structural profile properties may be provided by means of subtypes of IfcProfileProperties.


An IfcProfileDef is a two-dimensional geometric object with a xp,yp coordinate system. The profile is inserted into the curve member model thus that the origin of xp,yp is located at the member's reference curve and that xp,yp are parallel with and directed like the local y,z.



> NOTE  Due to convention in structural mechanics, axis names of IfcStructuralCurveMember differ from axis names of building elements like IfcBeam with profile set usages: The extrusion axis of IfcStructuralCurveMember is called x while the extrusion axis of a profiled IfcBeam is called z. Hence x,y,z of IfcStructuralCurveMember correspond with z,x,y of a profiled IfcBeam.


If the profile is meant to be inserted centrically in terms of structural section properties, it is necessary that the origin of xp,yp is identical with the geometric centroid of the profile (commonly also called centre of gravity). If subtypes of IfcParameterizedProfileDef are used which are only singly symmetric or are asymmetric, an explicit translation by IfcParameterizedProfileDef.Position.Location is required then.


If the profile is inserted at its geometric centroid, IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage.CardinalPoint shall be set to 10.


Otherwise, the profile is inserted eccentrically and a different cardinal point should be set accordingly.



> NOTE  Another eccentricity model is available independently of eccentric profile specification: The reference curve of the member may be located eccentrically relative to the reference points of the connected IfcStructuralPointConnections. The connection relationship is then established by IfcRelConnectsWithEccentricity. Whether one or the other or both eccentricity models may be used is subject to information requirements and local agreements.



### Reference Topology

Direct instances of IfcStructuralCurveMember shall have a topology representation which consists of one instance of IfcEdge or a subtype, representing the reference curve of the curve member. See definitions at IfcStructuralItem for further specifications.


**Informal Propositions**


1. The reference curve must not be parallel with Axis at any point within the curve member's domain.


The local coordinate system is established by the reference curve given by topology representation and by the attribute Axis. The local x axis is parallel with the tangent on the reference curve. The local z axis is located in the surface which is created by sweeping Axis along the reference curve and is directed according to Axis. The local y axis is directed such that x,y,z form a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system.

# IfcStructuralItem

The abstract entity _IfcStructuralItem_ is the generalization of structural members and structural connections, that is, analysis idealizations of elements in the building model. It defines the relation between structural members and connections with structural activities (actions and reactions).
<!-- end of short definition -->

Relationships between elements in the building model and structural items as their idealizations can be expressed by instances of _IfcRelAssignsToProduct_.

> HISTORY New entity in IFC2x2.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE Use definitions and informal proposition added.

****Coordinate Systems****:

The following coordinate systems are distinguished:

* The so-called global coordinate system is the coordinate system shared by all items and activities which are grouped in a common _IfcStructuralAnalysisModel_. This coordinate system is established by _SELF\IfcProduct.ObjectPlacement_. (This coordinate system is not necessarily the same as the _IfcProject_'s world coordinate system.)
* The so-called local coordinate system is a coordinate system local to a structural item (connection or member). This coordinate system is established by a _Representation_ (attribute inherited from _IfcProduct_) in conjunction with further use definitions and attributes of subtypes of _IfcStructuralItem_.

Representation items in topology representations are always given within the _ObjectPlacement_, i.e. in so-called global coordinates (global with respect to the _IfcStructuralAnalysisModel_ to which this item belongs).

The usage of local coordinate systems is further defined in subtypes.

****Topology Use Definitions****:

Instances of _IfcStructuralItem_ shall have a topology representation. It includes a placement and a product representation. The _IfcProductRepresentation_ shall be given by an item in a _Representation_ of type _IfcTopologyRepresentation_.

**Local Placement**

The local placement for _IfcStructuralItem_ is defined in its supertype _IfcProduct_. It is defined by the _IfcLocalPlacement_, which establishes a global coordinate system which shall be common to all items and activities in an _IfcStructuralAnalysisModel_.

**Topology Representation**

Instances of _IfcStructuralItem_ shall have a topology representation given by an instance of a subtype of _IfcTopologicalRepresentationItem_, which should be the single item of _IfcTopologyRepresentation.Items_. Depending on the dimensionality of the structural item, one of the following types of topological representation items shall be used:

* Point connections shall be represented by an _IfcVertexPoint_ with an underlying _IfcCartesianPoint_. The Cartesian point is the reference point of the connection in the so-called global coordinate system. The following labels are used in the _IfcTopologyRepresentation_:
  * _RepresentationIdentifier_: 'Reference'
  * _RepresentationType_: 'Vertex'
* Curve members and curve connections shall either be represented by an _IfcOrientedEdge_, _IfcEdgeCurve_, or _IfcEdge_. The curve to which the _IfcEdgeCurve_ (or an _IfcOrientedEdge_'s underlying _IfcEdgeCurve_) refers to is the reference curve of the structural item in the global coordinate system. Start and end vertex of the edge shall be _IfcVertexPoint_s with underlying _IfcCartesianPoint_s. The following labels are used in the _IfcTopologyRepresentation_:
  * _RepresentationIdentifier_: 'Reference'
  * _RepresentationType_: 'Edge'
>> NOTE While an _IfcEdge_ (or _IfcOrientedEdge_ with underlying _IfcEdge_) does not provide an explicit underlying curve geometry, it may be used to imply an underlying straight line as reference curve with the origin of the curve parameter at the start vertex point.
* Surface members and surface connections shall be represented by an _IfcFaceSurface_. The underlying surface defines the reference surface of the structural surface item in the global coordinate system. All edges in the bounds of the face shall conform to the rules for edge representations of structural curve item. The following labels are used in the _IfcTopologyRepresentation_:
  * _RepresentationIdentifier_: 'Reference'
  * _RepresentationType_: 'Face'

The reference point, reference curve, or reference surface partially or completely defines the local coordinate system of the represented structural item according to the following rules. In all cases, The local x,y,z directions form a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system.

_Structural point items_

* The reference point in the representation is the origin of the local coordinate system of the structural item.
* The axes of the local coordinate system are either parallel with and directed like the so-called global coordinate axes, or are oriented according to definitions at the respective subtype of _IfcStructuralItem_.

_Structural curve items_

* The u parameter origin of the reference curve in the representation is the origin of the local coordinate system of the structural item.
* The local x axis is parallel with the tangent on the curve and directed like the u parameter direction.
* The local y and z axes are oriented according to definitions at the respective subtypes of _IfcStructuralItem_.

_Structural surface items_

* The u,v parameter origin of the reference surface in the representation is the origin of the local coordinate system of the structural item.
* The local x and y directions follow the tangents on the surface and are in parallel with and directed like u and v respectively.
* The local z direction is in parallel with and directed like the surface normal.

**Informal Propositions**

1. The _ObjectPlacement_s of all structural items which are grouped into the same instance of _IfcStructuralAnalysisModel_ shall refer to the same instance of _IfcObjectPlacement_.

> NOTE This rule is necessary to achieve consistent topology representations. The topology representations of structural items in an analysis model are meant to share vertices and edges und must therefore have the same object placement.

> NOTE A structural item may be grouped into more than one analysis model. In this case, all these models must use the same instance of _IfcObjectPlacement_.

### SelfWeightCoefficients
The self weight coefficients specify ratios at which loads due to weight of members shall be included in the load case. These loads are not explicitly modeled as instances of _IfcStructuralAction_. Instead they shall be calculated according to geometry, section, and material of each member.

The three components of the self weight vector correspond with the x,y,z directions of the so-called global coordinates, i.e. the directions of the shared _ObjectPlacement_ of all items in an _IfcStructuralAnalysisModel_. For example, if the object placement defines a z axis which is upright like the _IfcProject_'s world coordinate system, then the self weight coefficients would typically be [0.,0.,-1.] in a load case of dead loads with self weight.

The overall coefficient in the inherited attribute _Coefficient_ shall not be applied to _SelfWeightCoefficients_ of the same instance of _IfcStructuralLoadCase_. It only applies to actions and load groups which are grouped below the load case, not to the load case's computed self weight.

As many instances of _IfcRelAssignsToGroupByFactor_ are used within one load combination as there are different _Factor_s to be applied to load cases in the load combination.

# IfcStructuralSurfaceAction

This entity defines an action which is distributed over a surface. A surface action may be connected with a surface member or surface connection.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> HISTORY New entity in IFC4.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE Former entity _IfcStructuralPlanarActionVarying_ from IFC2x2 has been removed and are replaced by this entity.

****Coordinate Systems****:

See definitions at _IfcStructuralActivity_.

****Topology Use Definitions****:

Standard Case:
If connected with a surface item and acting on its entirety, instances of _IfcStructuralCurveAction_ shall not have an _ObjectPlacement_ nor a _Representation_. It is implied that the placement and representation of the _IfcStructuralActivity_ is the same as the ones of the member or connection.

Special Case 1:
If connected with a surface item but acting only on a part of it, instances of _IfcStructuralSurfaceAction_ shall have an _ObjectPlacement_ and _Representation_, containing an _IfcFaceSurface_ which topologically defines the loaded part of the surface. See _IfcStructuralActivity_ for further definitions.

Special Case 2:
If not connected with a structural item (which may happen in an incomplete or conceptual model), a surface action should have an _ObjectPlacement_ and _Representation_, containing an _IfcFaceSurface_. See _IfcStructuralActivity_ for further definitions.

**Informal Propositions**

1. If the surface action is of the predefined type CONST, _SELF\IfcStructuralActivity.AppliedLoad_ must not be of type _IfcStructuralLoadConfiguration_.
2. If the surface action is of the predefined type BILINEAR, _SELF\IfcStructuralActivity.AppliedLoad_ shall be of type _IfcStructuralLoadConfiguration_ and shall contain three items with two-dimensional _IfcStructuralLoadConfiguration.Locations_, defining the location of the load samples in local coordinates of the surface action.
3. If the surface action is of the predefined type DISCRETE, _SELF\IfcStructuralActivity.AppliedLoad_ shall be of type _IfcStructuralLoadConfiguration_ and shall contain two or more items with two-dimensional locations.
4. Point loads must be of type DISCRETE, thus contain two or more load points. (Single point loads are modeled by _IfcStructuralLoadSingleForce_.)
5. All items in _SELF\IfcStructuralActivity.AppliedLoad\IfcStructuralLoadConfiguration.Values_ shall be of the same entity type.

## Attributes

### ProjectedOrTrue
Defines whether load values are given per true lengths of the surface on which they act, or per lengths of the projection of the surface in load direction. The latter is only applicable to loads which act in global coordinate directions.

### PredefinedType
Type of action according to its distribution of load values.

## Formal Propositions

### ProjectedIsGlobal
A load can only be related to projected lengths if it was specified in global coordinate directions (i.e. in analysis model coordinate directions). If a load was specified in local coordinate directions, it can only relate to true lengths.

### HasObjectType
The attribute ObjectType shall be given if the predefined type is set to USERDEFINED.

****Material Use Definition****

The material of direct instances _IfcStructuralSurfaceMember_ (in contrast to instances of the subtype _IfcStructuralSurfaceMemberVarying_) is defined by _IfcMaterial_ and attached by the _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial.RelatingMaterial_. It is accessible by the inverse _HasAssociations_ relationship.

The material is specified minimally by a name which corresponds with an agreed upon standardized structural material designation. An external reference to the source which specifies the material designation should be provided. Alternatively, structural material properties may be provided by means of _IfcMaterialProperties_.

Direct instances of _IfcStructuralSurfaceMember_ are assumed to be located centrically relative to their reference surface. Their depth is provided in the attribute _Thickness_.

## Attributes

### PredefinedType
Type of member with respect to its load carrying behaviour in this analysis idealization.

### Thickness
Defines the typically understood thickness of the structural surface member, measured normal to its reference surface.

## Formal Propositions

### HasObjectType
The attribute ObjectType shall be given if the predefined type is set to USERDEFINED.

## Concepts

### Material Layer Set Usage

The material of direct instances IfcStructuralSurfaceMember (in contrast to instances of the subtype IfcStructuralSurfaceMemberVarying) is defined by IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage and attached by the _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial.RelatingMaterial_. It is accessible by the inverse HasAssociations relationship.

The material is specified minimally by a name which corresponds with an agreed upon standardized structural material designation. An external reference to the source which specifies the material designation should be provided. Alternatively, structural material properties may be provided by means of IfcMaterialProperties.

In the absence of material layer set usage, direct instances of IfcStructuralSurfaceMember are assumed to be located centrically relative to their reference surface. Their depth is provided in the attribute Thickness.

### Reference Topology

Direct instances of IfcStructuralSurfaceMember shall have a topology representation which consists of one IfcFaceSurface, representing the reference surface of the surface member. See definitions at IfcStructuralItem for further specifications.

The local coordinate system is established by the reference surface given by topology representation.

### Structural Connectivity



#### IfcStructuralCurveConnection

Connections to curve members along edge(s) of surface.

#### IfcStructuralSurfaceConnection

Connections to surface members within face(s) of surface.

IfcStructuralAnalysisDomain
===========================

The _IfcStructuralAnalysisDomain_ describes the structural analysis model in order to tightly integrate the structural engineering domain. It reuses the existing building element and spatial structure element definition and associates the structural assumptions to it. The focus is to ensure that structural engineering information is captured and made visible to other related domains.

The following features are in scope:

* Defining planar and/or spatial structural analysis models which can be used by structural analysis applications.
* Included are, basically:
    *  Straight or curved structural curve elements, planar or curved structural surface elements.
    *  Point, curve, and surface connections and supports.
    *  Specification of loadings including point, curve, surface loads, temperature loads, their assignment to load groups, load cases and load combinations.
    *  Specification of different structural analysis models in order to describe different aspects or parts of the building. Furthermore, dependencies between these models can be stored in the model for further use.
    *  Analysis results defined by forces and displacements.

Currently not in scope are:

* Dynamic analysis
*  Description of prestressed loads
*  Finite element topology
*  Detailed results in finite element meshes as well as stresses and strains in the structural elements.

# IfcActionSourceTypeEnum

This enumeration type contains possible action sources.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> HISTORY New enumeration in IFC2x2.

## Items

### DEAD_LOAD_G
The structure carries the dead load, which includes its own weight, the weight of any permanent non-structural partitions, built-in cupboards, floor surfacing materials and other finishes.

### COMPLETION_G1
Completion.

### LIVE_LOAD_Q
All the movable objects in a building such as people, desks, cupboards and filing cabinets produce an imposed load on the structure. This loading may come and go with the result that its intensity will vary considerably. At one moment a room may be empty, yet at another packed with people.

### SNOW_S
The magnitude of the snow load will depend upon the latitude and altitude of the site. In the lower latitudes no snow would be expected while in the high latitudes snow could last for six months or more.

### WIND_W
The wind acts both on the main structure and on the individual cladding units. The structure has to be braced to resist the horizontal load and anchored to the ground to prevent the whole building from being blown away, if the dead weight of the building is not sufficient to hold it down.

### PRESTRESSING_P
Presstressing load.

### SETTLEMENT_U
If one part of a building settles more than another part, then stresses are set up in the structures.

### TEMPERATURE_T
All building materials expand or contract with temperature change. Long continuous buildings will expand, and it is necessary to consider the expansion stresses.

### EARTHQUAKE_E
Earthquake loads affect the design of structures in areas of great seismic activity.

### FIRE
Fire action on the build facility.

### IMPULSE
Load from impulse force.

### IMPACT
Impact force from an object hitting the facility.

### TRANSPORT
Loads from transport.

### ERECTION
Loads on the facility that occur during erection, but not after completion.

### PROPPING
Propping

### SYSTEM_IMPERFECTION
Loads from imperfections in the system.

### SHRINKAGE
Loads from shrinkage.

### CREEP
Forces due to creep.

### LACK_OF_FIT
Lack of fit.

### BUOYANCY
Buoyancy.

### ICE
Loads from ice.

### CURRENT
Current.

### WAVE
Loads from a wave hitting the structure.

### RAIN
Rain and water on the structure.

### BRAKES
Brakes

# IfcReinforcementDefinitionProperties

_IfcReinforcementDefinitionProperties_ defines the cross section properties of reinforcement included in reinforced concrete building elements. The property set definition may be used both in conjunction with insitu and precast structures.
<!-- end of short definition -->

This subtype of _IfcPropertySetDefinition_ is used to define the reinforcement properties in early design stages, such as in requirement definition or scheme design. In later design stages explicit instances of subtypes of _IfcReinforcingElement_ are used. The intended usage may be indicated using the _DefinitionType_ attribute value as a designator: recommended values are 'Reinforcement area requirement' or 'Reinforcement configuration requirement'. Other values may be used according to local standards.

Only one property set definition of this kind is used for each concrete building element in each intended usage indicated by the _DefinitionType_ attribute value. This set then defines a list of cross section properties in a discrete number of longitudinal sections as instances of _IfcSectionReinforcementProperties_ (one for each structural reinforcement bar role), which in turn have a section cross section property defined as a profile and a number of reinforcement properties, one for each steel grade / bar type.

    # IfcSurfaceFeature

A surface feature is a modification at (onto, or into) of the surface of an element. Parts of the surface of the entire surface may be affected. The volume and mass of the element may be increased, remain unchanged, or be decreased by the surface feature, depending on manufacturing technology. However, any increase or decrease of volume is small compared to the total volume of the element.
<!-- end of short definition -->

The part–whole relationship is established by an aggregation relationship object, expressing the decomposition of an element type into one or more additive elements (element parts) and zero or more feature elements.

> HISTORY New entity in IFC4.

****Containment Use Definition****:

Surface features shall have no spatial containment relationship to the spatial structure since they are dependent on element types without spatial containment relationships or on an element occurrence with own spatial containment relationship.

* The _SELF\IfcElement.ContainedInStructure_ relationship shall be NIL.

****Geometry use definition****:

The geometric representation of _IfcSurfaceFeature_ is given by the _IfcProductDefinitionShape_, allowing multiple geometric representation.

**Local Placement**

The local placement for _IfcSurfaceFeature_ is defined in its supertype _IfcProduct_. It is defined by the _IfcLocalPlacement_, which defines the local coordinate system that is referenced by all geometric representations.

* In case of features which are voiding an element occurrence, the _PlacementRelTo_ relationship of _IfcLocalPlacement_ shall point to the local placement of the respective element.

**Shape representation**

Different shape representations may be used, depending on the nature of the feature and information requirements:

* Symbolic representation, such as the two-dimensional bounding box of a tag.
* A geometric set representing the geometric items of a mark.
* Surface representations of treated parts of the element surface by means of _IfcShellBasedSurfaceModel_. The faces within the surface model may be included into a B-Rep model within a representation map of the parent element type.

IfcStructuralElementsDomain
===========================

The schema _IfcStructuralElementsDomain_ provides the ability to represent different kinds of building elements and building element parts which in general are of structural nature. In addition to generally used building elements already defined in the _IfcSharedBldgElements_ schema, the schema contains entities for representing foundation parts, such as footings and piles, as well as some important structural subparts included in other building elements, such as different kinds of explicit reinforcement parts, and manufactured features and treatments.

IfcActorResource
================

The _IfcActorResource_ schema within the IFC model enables representation of information concerning a person or an organization that will undertake work or hold responsibility. The _IfcActorResource_ schema is developed as a separate resource schema containing identified actor related classes because it is a general idea that can be related to many other classes.

The classes and attributes within the _IfcActorResource_ schema supports the identification of properties of persons and organizations whose services may be used. Additionally it supports relating persons to organizations, and relationships between organizations, such as to form hierarchical organization structures. The scope of the schema is to be sufficient for the purposes of a model dealing with project design and construction and for management of the constructed facility (within the scope of business processes supported by this release of the IFC model) following project completion. The information content of the schema is not sufficient for the exchange of detailed information about human resources.

> NOTE  The schema _IfcActorResource_ has been developed with reference to the schema <span class="ext-ref">person_organization</span> within [ISO 10303-41](../content/bibliography.htm#iso-10303-41). The definitions within [ISO 10303-41](../content/bibliography.htm#iso-10303-41) have been adopted with modifications to meet the particular requirements imposed by business processes in building design, construction and facilities management operations.

IfcApprovalResource
===================

The _IfcApprovalResource_ schema in the resource layer defines basic concepts for approvals to be assigned to any object or object type or property definition in the IFC model derived from _IfcRoot_. The assignment is done using _IfcRelAssociatesApproval_ in the _IfcControlExtension_ schema. Also, approvals can be assigned to specific resource level objects (documents, properties, persons/organizations or materials), using _IfcResourceApprovalRelationship_.

# IfcConstraint

An _IfcConstraint_ is used to define a constraint or limiting value or boundary condition that may be applied to an object or to the value of a property.
<!-- end of short definition -->

Constraints may be subdivided into user-defined constraints and system-defined constraints. User-defined constraints are applied by a user and are restricted to high-level definitions such as object properties. System-defined constraints may apply to any object attribute, are typically defined by an application to enforce data validation or parametric behaviour, and are intended to be enforced by applications but not to be directly editable by an end-user.

_IfcConstraint_ may be associated with any subtype of _IfcObjectDefinition_ or _IfcPropertyDefinition_ through the _IfcRelAssociatesConstraint_ relationship to indicate a system-defined constraint, or may be associated with _IfcResourceObjectSelect_ (such as _IfcPropertySingleValue_) by _IfcResourceConstraintRelationship_ to indicate a user-defined constraint.

A constraint must have a name applied through the _IfcConstraint.Name_ attribute and optionally, a description through _IfcConstraint.Description_. The grade of the constraint (hard, soft, advisory) must be specified through _IfcConstraint.ConstraintGrade_ or _IfcConstraint.UserDefinedGrade_ whilst the source, creating actor and time at which the constraint is created may be optionally asserted through _IfcConstraint.ConstraintSource_, _IfcConstraint.CreatingActor_ and _IfcConstraint.CreationTime_.

A constraint may also have additional external information (such as classification or document information) associated to it by _IfcExternalReferenceRelationship_, accessible through inverse attribute _IfcConstraint.HasExternalReferences_

> HISTORY New entity in IFC2.0

## Attributes

### Name
A human-readable name to be used for the constraint.

### Description
A human-readable description that may apply additional information about a constraint.

### ConstraintGrade
Enumeration that qualifies the type of constraint.

### ConstraintSource
Any source material, such as a code or standard, from which the constraint originated.

### CreatingActor
Person and/or organization that has created the constraint.

### CreationTime
Time when information specifying the constraint instance was created.

### UserDefinedGrade
Allows for specification of user defined grade of the constraint beyond the enumeration values (hard, soft, advisory) provided by ConstraintGrade attribute of type _IfcConstraintEnum_.
When a value is provided for attribute UserDefinedGrade in parallel the attribute ConstraintGrade shall have enumeration value USERDEFINED.

A null value indicates a reference to the type or entity itself, such as for indicating that the type of a value must match a specified constraint.

### InstanceName
Optionally identifies an instance within a collection according to name. If the instance has an attribute called 'Name', such attribute is used for comparison; otherwise the first STRING-based attribute of the entity is used.

IfcConstraintResource
=====================

The _IfcConstraintResource_ schema provides for the specification of constraints (_IfcConstraint_) that may be applied to any object that is a subtype of _IfcObjectDefinition_ or _IfcPropertyDefinition_ (through the provision of the relationship class _IfcRelAssociatesConstraint_). Also, constraints may be applied to specific resource objects, such as an _IfcProperty_ (through the provision of the relationship class _IfcResourceConstraintRelationship_).

A grade may be set for the constraint that establishes whether it is a hard constraint (must be satisfied), a soft constraint (should be satisfied) or simply advisory.

A constraint must be named and may optionally have one or more sources within which it is defined or from which it is taken. Additionally, a constraint may optionally be assigned a creating actor, creation date and a description.

Constraints may be either qualitative (an objective constraint) or quantitative (a measured constraint or metric). A qualifier can be applied to an objective constraint that determines the purpose for which it is applied. It may be applied to define the constraining values beyond which building codes may be violated or to limit the selectable range of values as in a specification (for example, value of A must be greater than A but less than B). Several possible purposes are provided through an enumeration.

A measured constraint or metric defines the actual value or values of a constraint. Values can be defined in terms of a benchmark requirement which sets the intent of the constraint, for example, whether the benchmark is greater than (>), or less than (<). The value of a constraint may be defined according to a number of data types that are available through a select mechanism.

> EXAMPLE  A constraint advised by a manufacturer beyond which maintenance must be undertaken on a pump might be qualified as a 'TriggerCondition', named 'PumpMaintenanceCondition', have as its source 'ManufacturerData' and be graded as 'Advisory'. It could have as a single value 10\^-2 / sec as the frequency of vibration and have a benchmark of 'GreaterThanOrEqualTo'.

# IfcAppliedValue

This entity captures a value driven by a formula, with additional qualifications including unit basis, valid date range, and categorization.
<!-- end of short definition -->

The extent of the _IfcAppliedValue_ is determined by the _AppliedValue_ attribute which may be defined either as an _IfcMeasureWithUnit_ or as an _IfcMonetaryMeasure_ or as an _IfcRatioMeasure_ via the _IfcAppliedValueSelect_ type.

Optionally, an _IfcAppliedValue_ may have an applicable date. This is intended to fix the date on which the value became relevant for use. It may be the date on which the value was set in the model or it may be a prior or future date when the value becomes operable. Similarly, an _IfcAppliedValue_ may have a 'fixed until' date. This is intended to fix the date on which the value ceases to be relevant for use.

An instance of _IfcAppliedValue_ may have a unit basis asserted. This is defined as an _IfcMeasureWithUnit_ that determines the extent of the unit value for application purposes. It is assumed that when this attribute is asserted, then the value given to _IfcAppliedValue_ is that for unit quantity. This is not enforced within the schema and thus needs to be controlled within an application.

Applied values may be referenced from a document (such as a price list). The relationship between one or more occurrences of _IfcAppliedValue_ (or its subtypes) is achieved through the use of the _IfcExternalReferenceRelationship_ in which the document provides the _IfcExternalReferenceRelationship.RelatingExtReference_ and the value occurrences are the _IfcExternalReferenceRelationship.RelatedResourceObjects_.

The description that may apply additional information about a cost value.

### AppliedValue
The extent or quantity or amount of an applied value.

### UnitBasis
The number and unit of measure on which the unit cost is based.

Note: As well as the normally expected units of measure such as length, area, volume etc., costs may be based on units of measure which need to be defined e.g. sack, drum, pallet, item etc. Unit costs may be based on quantities greater (or lesser) than a unitary value of the basis measure. For instance, timber may have a unit cost rate per X meters where X > 1; similarly for cable, piping and many other items. The basis number may be either an integer or a real value.

Note: This attribute should be asserted for all circumstances where the cost to be applied is per unit quantity. It may be asserted even for circumstances where an item price is used, in which case the unit cost basis should be by item (or equivalent definition).

IfcCostResource
===============

The _IfcCostResource_ schema provides the means to identify cost values.

A cost value specifies an amount or a value that has an effect on the amount that is applied to an object in the units of measure applicable to the value type. A cost value may have an applicable date that can be used to provide a basis on which fluctuations in price can be established or that otherwise identifies when the cost value was applied.

Each cost value may have a unit basis which determines how a total value should be determined for objects. This is relevant where values are identified per unit quantity of an item.

An individual cost value may be defined according to the values of a set of component values and may also be identified as a component of other values. This is achieved through the assertion of an applied value relationship which acts as a container for applied value components.

For cost values, the following guidance applies:

* _IfcMeasureWithUnit_ allows the specification of both the actual figure for the value together with the currency in which the value is represented.
* Selecting _IfcMonetaryMeasure_ allows the specification only of the value, the currency being as set by the global context.
* Selecting _IfcRatioMeasure_ assumes that the amount is a percentage or other REAL number. Note that if the amount is normally specified as -20%, then this figure will need to be converted to a multiplier of 0.8

<!-- end of short definition -->

All given values should be provided by the application, that is, the IFC schema does not deal with dependencies between process time values. At this stage there is also no consistency check through where rules that guarantee a meaningful population of date values. Thus, an application is responsible to provide reasonable values and, if an application receives event dates, has to make consistency checks by their own.

_IfcEventTime_ furthermore provides a generic mechanism to differentiate between user given time values and time values derived from user given time values and other constraints such as work calendars and assigned resources (derived from the process graph). The data origin flag is provided as a single attribute applying to all date time related attributes of _IfcEventTime_.

# IfcLagTime

_IfcLagTime_ describes the time parameters that may exist within a sequence relationship between two processes.
<!-- end of short definition -->

An _IfcLagTime_ provides information about the time lag that exists between the predecessor and successor process in a sequence. The assertion of the time lag is optional for a sequence but for work schedules that specifically deal with processes occurring at particular times, it should be asserted.

A lag time has a duration type. This allows the identification of whether elapsed time or work time is being measured (where work time is the estimate of the time required to complete the process and elapsed time being the amount of time actually allocated to the process)

The form of measurement of the duration can be captured. Allowed values for this are MEASURED, PREDICTED or SIMULATED. The selection of this value depends on the use of the schedule. A NOTDEFINED value is also allowed.

The value of the time lag may be selected as being either a percentage ratio or an actual time measure. If selected as a ratio, the percentage should apply to the duration of the predecessor process (relating process) such that e.g. a value of 0.5 (50%) would indicate that the successor task should start when the predecessor task is 50% complete (if a START-START sequence type is used) or should wait for 50% of the duration of the predecessor process to have elapsed after the finish of the predecessor process in case of a FINISH-START sequence type.

The time unit for the task duration may also be set and this may be set to any allowed unit of time measure.

In that case it is assumed that the time period begins at 0:00 on the start date and ends at 24:00 on the finish date.

The start and finish date is optional if a recurrence pattern is given (_IfcWorkTime.RecurrencePattern_). They then restrict never-ending recurrence patterns.

> HISTORY New entity in IFC4.

## Attributes

### RecurrencePattern
Recurrence pattern that defines a time period, which, if given, is
  valid within the time period defined by
  _IfcWorkTime.Start_ and _IfcWorkTime.Finish_.

### Start
Start date of the work time (0:00), that might be further
  restricted by a recurrence pattern.

### Finish
End date of the work time (24:00), that might be further
  restricted by a recurrence pattern.

IfcDateTimeResource
===================

The _IfcDateTimeResource_ schema defines several generic date and time specific concepts that can be used to identify context within calendars, schedules, and time series. These concepts include:

*  _IfcDate_, _IfcTime_, _IfcDateTime_ and _IfcDuration_. All given values should be provided in context and converted into a Gregorian date context and be shall be processable by a receiving application.
* Time series, which are a set of discrete data each with an associated date and time stamp, allowing a natural association of data collected over intervals of time. Time series data can be represented using the following entities:
    *  _IfcRegularTimeSeries_: Time series data arrive predictably at predefined intervals and are represented by the entity, and
    *  _IfcIrregularTimeSeries_: some or all time stamps do not follow a repetitive pattern and unpredictable bursts of data may arrive at unspecified points in time.  Time series data must be normalized using the following rules:
    * All time (universal, local, daylight savings, and solar) is normalized against the ISO 8601 standard GMT/UTC (Universal Coordinated Time).
    * The normalized data refer to the preceding time unit.
    * Any rollover is handled by the application providing the data. Rollover occurs, for example, when the measurement device resets itself while measuring and the recording data do not include the data measured before the reset.
    * Only the time when data are taken is recorded.
* Time associated with processes such as resource allocation (_IfcResourceTime_), time for task completion (_IfcTaskTime_), work patterns (_IfcWorkTime_), and scheduled events (_IfcEventTime_).

> NOTE  The schema _IfcDateTimeResource_ includes definitions that are based on [ISO 8601](../content/bibliography.htm#iso-8601)

> HISTORY  This schema has been significantly modified in IFC4. The original concepts of _IfcDateTimeResource_ and _IfcTimeSeriesResource_ were introduced in IFC2.0 and IFC2x2 and merged into the _IfcDateTimeResource_ in IFC4.

# IfcClassification

An _IfcClassification_ is used for the arrangement of objects into a class or category according to a common purpose or their possession of common characteristics. A classification in the sense of _IfcClassification_ is taxonomy, or taxonomic scheme, arranged in a hierarchical structure. A category of objects relates to other categories in a generalization-specialization relationship. Therefore the classification items in an classification are organized in a tree structure.
<!-- end of short definition -->

The _IfcClassification_ identifies the classification system or source to which a classification reference refers to. Each classification reference may reference an instance of _IfcClassification_. A classification system declared may be either formally published, or it may be a locally defined method of classifying information.

> NOTE Examples for such formally published classifications are Omniclass, Uniclass, Masterformat, or DIN277.

There are two methods to define and reference a classification system:

1. Including the classification system structure within the dataset: Here a hierarchical tree of _IfcClassificationReference_'s is included that defines the classification system including the relationship between the classification items. The _ReferencedSource_ attribute of _IfcClassificationReference_ links the classification item to the parent item, and the parent item finally to the _IfcClassification_.
2. Referencing the classification system by a classification key or id: Here the _IfcClassificationReference_ is used to assign a classification id or key as _Identification_ attribute and it may link by _ReferencedSource_ attribute directly to the _IfcClassification_.

This typically applies then the _IfcClassification_ is used in
conjunction with _IfcClassificationReference_'s. If only one _ReferenceToken_ is provided, it applies to all boundaries of individual facets, if more than one _ReferenceToken_ are provided, the first token applies to the first boundary, the second token to the second boundary, and the n^th^ token to the n^th^ and any additional boundary.

# IfcClassificationReference

An _IfcClassificationReference_ is a reference into a classification system or source (see _IfcClassification_) for a specific classification key (or notation).
<!-- end of short definition -->

The inherited attributes have the following meaning:

* _Identification_: holds the key provided for a specific references to classification items (or tables).
* _Name_: allows for a human interpretable designation of a classification notation.
* _Location_: optionally holds a direct URI link into the classification system (or source) to hyperlink the classification key.

The _IfcClassificationReference_ can either be assigned directly to the _IfcClassification_, such as if no classification hierarchy has to be included, or it references the parent classification notation, if the fully classification hierarchy is included in the data set. The first is referred to as "lightweight classification", and the second as "full classification". The attribute _ReferencedSource_ then holds the following information (choice by _IfcClassificationReferenceSelect_):

1. being of type _IfcClassification_: direct reference to the classification system (with meta information provided);
2. being of type _IfcClassificationReference_: reference to the parent classification notation within the classification hierarchy.

> EXAMPLE The _IfcClassificationReference_ can be used as a form of 'lightweight' classification through the '_Identification_' attribute inherited from the abstract _IfcExternalReference_ class. In this case, the '_Identification_' could take (for instance) the Uniclass notation "L6814" which, if the classification was well understood by all parties and was known to be taken from a particular classification source, would be sufficient. The _Name_ attribute could be the title "Tanking". This would remove the need for the overhead of the more complete classification structure of the model.

# IfcLibraryReference

An _IfcLibraryReference_ is a reference into a library of information by _Location_ (provided as a URI). It also provides an optional inherited _Identification_ key to allow more specific references to library sections or tables. The inherited _Name_ attribute allows for a human interpretable identification of the library item. Also, general information on the library from which the reference is taken, is given by the _ReferencedLibrary_ relation which identifies the relevant occurrence of _IfcLibraryInformation_.
<!-- end of short definition -->

The _IfcLibraryReference_ additionally provides the capability to handle multilingual library entries. The _Language_ attribute then holds the language tag for the language used by the strings kept in the _Name_ and the _Description_ attribute.

Depending on the type of technology used by the library, different IfcLibraryReference.Identification identifiers will be appropriate:

Publisher | Technology | Identifier
--- | --- | ---
ASHRAE | BACnet | 32-bit decimal BACnetObjectIdentifier indicating type ID and instance ID (e.g.'12.15' for Digital Input #15).
Brick Development Team | Brick | Full URI with no abbreviation (e.g. 'http://example.org/digitaltwin#AHU01', not 'digitaltwin:AHU01')
IETF | IPv4 | 32-bit decimal address for an IPv4 network (e.g.'192.168.1.1').
IETF | IPv6 | 128-bit hexadecimal address for an IPv6 network.
IETF | MAC | 48-bit hexadecimal form of MAC address.
ISOIEC | LonTalk | 48-bit hexadecimal neuron ID.
OPCFoundation | OPC | Hierarchical ItemID in alphanumeric form (i.e. 'B204.Tank2.Temperature)

IfcExternalReferenceResource
============================

The _IfcExternalReferenceResource_ provides the means to access or use information from external sources including:

* Classifications
* Documents
* Libraries

### 8.6.1.1 Classifications
A classification is a label having a value whose meaning is determined in an index or classification system. Values and meanings may be declared externally or they may be directly declared within an exchange file. It provides for:

* one or more classification notations to an object.
* one or more facets to a classification notation.
* referencing of facets of a classification notation from a described source (classification item or classification table)
* exposure of the hierarchy of a classification structure.
* identification of the classification source
* referencing a classification held on an external source.

### 8.6.1.2 Documents
The scope of the documents model is:

* to manage reference to documents
* to manage information about documents
* to be equally applicable to documents that are paper based or digital

It is not intended to be a complete document model and does not overlap in intent or content with such models.

Information may be referenced from external sources. Reference to a document is by its location (address) to enable access through mechanisms such as the World Wide Web. This is done through the _IfcDocumentReference_ class. This is a type of _IfcExternalReference_ that has a label (which can be the reference address) and identifier. Additionally, a name attribute provides the document with a human readable extension or qualifier to the location. Information concerning the document itself can also be stored as an attribute of the document reference.

Information about a document can be captured in the _IfcDocumentInformation_ class. This identifies and names the document and document owner. It may also include for the document:

* description
* revision identifier
* creation and revision times
* duration of document validity using 'valid from' and 'valid to' attributes.

Documents frequently hold references to information held in other documents, for example, documents referencing standards that are also documents. A significant tree structure of document information referencing could be built up in this way. Such relationships between document information can be captured through the _IfcDocumentInformationRelationship_ class which manages both relating and related document information and inversely captures the document information carrying the pointer and the document information to which pointers refer.

### 8.6.1.3 Libraries
The scope of the library model is to be able to reference information stored in external data libraries. It is assumed that, most frequently, information will populate property sets within an IFC model and that many of these property sets will be defined outside of this specification.

The _IfcLibraryInformation_ entity provides specific information about an actual library data source including its name, version, version date, publisher and publication location. Additionally it can be assigned to high level objects in a Building Information Model such as a Project or Building where there may be a need to identify the library used.

The _IfcLibraryReference_ entity is more widely used (and should be considered as the default selection). A library reference provides for the identifying of a specific record within a library data source through use of a name, location (web location) and item reference (which locates the data within the library data source). The provision of a language attribute allows the language in which a library reference is expressed to be identified

The placement of _IfcAlignmentHorizontalSegment_ and the _IfcCurveSegment_ _StartPlacement_ correspond to each other.
<!-- end of short definition -->

The following information can be calculated (and is therefore not exchanged explicitly to avoid redundancy and inconsistencies)

* the end point (from start point, direction, segment length and curve parameter)
* the start distance along (from the end distance along of the previous segment, or the start distance along of the horizontal alignment (if it is the first segment)
* the end distance along (from the start distance and the segment length)
* the end direction (from the curve parameter, the start direction and the segment length)
* the point of intersection (from the start direction and the end direction)

The following checks can be done to validate the correct exchange:

* continuity – does the calculated end point of the previous segment matches with the provided start point of this segment
* tangential continuity – does the calculated end direction of the previous segment matches with the provided start direction of this segment

## Attributes

### StartPoint
The start point of the segment defined by a Cartesian point.

### StartDirection
The direction of the tangent at the start point. Direction value 0. indicates a curve with a start tangent along the positive x-axis. Values increases counter-clockwise, and decreases clockwise. Depending on the plane angle unit, either degree or radians, the sensible range is -360° ≤ n ≤ 360° (or -2π ≤ n ≤ 2π). Values larger then a full circle (>|360°| or >|2 π| shall not be used.

### StartRadiusOfCurvature

If the radius is 0 it shall be interpreted as INFINITE. Positive values imply a CCW direction whereas negative CW.

### EndRadiusOfCurvature
For a NONLINEAR horizontal segment type the radius of the curve at the end point. If the radius is 0 it shall be interpreted as INFINITE. Positive values imply a CCW direction whereas negative CW.

The vertical alignment is defined by segments that connects end-to-start. The vertical alignment curve geometry is defined in a plane with x = distance along horizontal, the y = height (or elevation). The transition at the segment connection is not enforced to be tangential, The _IfcSegment_ _Transition_ enumeration specifies the type of transition explicitly.

The following vertical segment types are defined:

* line segment - _IfcAlignmentVerticalSegmentTypeEnum_ .LINE.
* circular arc segment - _IfcAlignmentVerticalSegmentTypeEnum_ .ARC.
* parabolic arc segment - _IfcAlignmentVerticalSegmentTypeEnum_ .PARABOLICARC. which can describe symmetric parabolas, unsymmetric parabolas can be created by defining two symmetric parabolas segments
* transition segment with linear curvature variation - _IfcAlignmentVerticalSegmentTypeEnum_ .CLOTHOID.

For each vertical segment, the following non-redundant information is provided:

* the start point (in distance along/ height coordinates)
* the start gradient (as a ratio measure with horizontal being 0, uphill positive, and downhill negative) usually between 1 < n < -1 (equal to a percentage of 100% < n < -100%, or to a degree of 45° < n < -45° but higher values are possible)
* the length (as horizontal length along the distance along (not the curve segment length))
* the curve parameter needed for circular and parabolic arc segments

The following information can be calculated (and is therefore not exchanged explicitly to avoid redundancy and inconsistencies)

* the end distance along (from the distance along and segment length)
* the end height (from start distance along, gradient, length and curve parameter)
* the end direction (from start direction, segment length and curve parameter)
* the point of vertical intersection (from start direction and end direction)

The following checks can be done to validate the correct exchange:

* continuity – does the calculated end distance along of the previous segment matches with the provided start distance along of this segment
* tangential continuity – does the calculated end gradient of the previous segment matches with the provided start gradient of this segment

> NOTE Specific subtypes of the <span class="self-ref">IfcAlignmentVerticalSegment</span> add specific geometric curve parameters. Connectivity between vertical segments is not necessarily tangential, but this can be enforced as a requirement through the attribute _TangentialContinuity_.

<!-- end of short definition -->

The _IfcCurve_ (or the _IfcEdgeCurve_ with an associated _IfcCurve_) at the _CurveOnRelatingElement_ attribute defines the curve where the basic geometry items of the connected elements connects. The curve geometry and coordinates are provided within the local coordinate system of the _RelatingElement_, as specified at the _IfcRelConnects_ subtype that utilizes the _IfcConnectionCurveGeometry_. Optionally, the same curve geometry and coordinates can also be provided within the local coordinate system of the _RelatedElement_ by using the _CurveOnRelatedElement_ attribute.

The available geometry for the connection constraint may be further restricted to only allow straight segments by applying _IfcPolyline_ only. Such an usage constraint is provided at the object definition of the _IfcElement_ subtype, utilizing the element connection by referring to the subtype of _IfcRelConnects_ with the associated _IfcConnectionCurveGeometry._

_IfcConnectionPointEccentricity_ is used to describe the geometric constraints that facilitate the physical connection of two objects at a point or vertex point with associated point coordinates. There is a physical distance, or eccentricity, etween the connection points of both object. The eccentricity can be either given by:

* providing the _PointOnRelatingElement_ and the _PointOnRelatedElement_, where both point coordinates are not identical within a common parent coordinate system (latestly within the world coordinate system),
* providing the _PointOnRelatingElement_ and the three distance measures, _EccentricityInX_, _EccentricityInY_, and _EccentricityInZ_ (or only _EccentricityInX_, and _EccentricityInY_ if the underlying coordinate system is two-dimensional), or
* providing both.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> NOTE  If both, _PointOnRelatedElement_, and _EccentricityInX_, _EccentricityInY_, (_EccentricityInZ_) are provided, the values should be consistent. In case of any non-consistency, the calculated distance between _PointOnRelatingElement_ and _PointOnRelatedElement_ takes precedence.

The _IfcPoint_ (or the _IfcVertexPoint_ with an associated _IfcPoint_) at the _PointOnRelatingElement_ attribute defines the point where the basic geometry items of the connected elements connects. The point coordinates are provided within the local coordinate system of the _RelatingElement_, as specified at the _IfcRelConnects_ subtype that utilizes the _IfcConnectionPointGeometry_. Optionally, the same point coordinates can also be provided within the local coordinate system of the _RelatedElement_ by using the _PointOnRelatedElement_ attribute, otherwise the distance to the point at the RelatedElement has to be given by the three eccentricity values.

The explicit values for _EccentricityInX_, _EccentricityInY_, and _EccentricityInZ_ are always measured in the following direction and coordinate system (defining when the value is positive or negative):

* from the _PointOnRelatedElement_ to _PointOnRelatingElement_ within the coordinate system of the _RelatingElement_.
* in addition: when used to specify connections in structural analysis models, the _IfcStructuralMember_ is to be used as the _RelatingElement_ of the relationship object utilizing _IfcConnectionPointEccentricity_, and the _IfcStructuralConnection_ is the _RelatedElement_.

# IfcGridAxis

An individual axis, _IfcGridAxis_, is defined in the context of a design grid. The axis definition is based on a curve of dimensionality 2. The grid axis is positioned within the XY plane of the position coordinate system defined by the _IfcGrid_.
<!-- end of short definition -->

The standard geometric representation of _IfcGridAxis_ is defined using a 2D curve entity. Grid axes are normally defined by an offset to another axis. The _IfcOffsetCurve2D_ supports this concept. Each grid axis has a sense given by the parameterization of the curve. The attribute _SameSense_ is an indicator of whether or not the sense of the grid axis agrees with, or opposes, that of the underlying curve.

![design grid](../../../../figures/ifcgridaxis-layout1.gif)

Figure 1 — Grid axis

As shown in Figure 1, the grid axis is defined as a 2D curve within the xy plane of the position coordinate system. Any curve can be used to define a grid axis, most common is the use of IfcLine for linear grids and <em>IfcCircle</em> for radial grids.

Most grids are defined by a pair of axis lists, each defined by a base grid axis and axes given by an offset to the base axis. The use of <em>IfcOffsetCurve2D</em> as underlying AxisCurve supports this concept.

> HISTORY New entity in IFC1.0

## Attributes

### AxisTag

### AxisCurve

### SameSense

### WR1
The dimensionality of the grid axis is 2.

### WR2
The _IfcGridAxis_ needs to be used by exactly one of the three attributes of _IfcGrid_:
* _UAxes_
* _VAxes_
* _WAxes_


i.e. it can only refer to a single instance of _IfcGrid_ in one of the three list of axes.

<!-- end of short definition -->

 IFC4.3.0.0 CHANGE In IFC 4.3 the _PlacementRelTo_ attribute has been moved from IfcLocalPlacement to its supertype IfcObjectPlacement, also a supertype of this entity. That means that for correct global positioning, the IfcGridPlacement will reference (a) the ObjectPlacement of the IfcGrid by means of IfcObjectPlacement.PlacementRelTo and (b) the pair of IfcGridAxis contained in that same grid by means of the IfcVirtualGridIntersection.

_IfcGridPlacement_ provides a specialization of _IfcObjectPlacement_ in which the placement and axis direction of the object coordinate system is defined by a reference to the design grid as defined in _IfcGrid_.

The location of the object coordinate system is given by the attribute _PlacementLocation_. It is defined as an _IfcVirtualGridIntersection_, that is, an intersection between two grid axes with optional offsets.

The axis direction of the x-axis of the object coordinate system is given either:

* _PlacementRefDirection_ = NIL: by the tangent of the first grid axis (_PlacementLocation.IntersectingAxes[1]_) at the virtual intersection (maybe using the offset curve, if _PlacementLocation.OffsetDistances_ is given);
* _PlacementRefDirection_ = _IfcDirection_: by the explicitly provided direction information;
* _PlacementRefDirection_ = _IfcVirtualGridIntersection_: by the tangent between the virtual grid intersection of _PlacementLocation_ and the virtual grid intersection of _PlacementRefDirection_. Offsets as potentially provided in the _IfcVirtualGridIntersection_'s of _PlacementLocation_ and _PlacementRefDirection_ have to be taken into account.

The direction of the y-axis of the _IfcGridPlacement_ is the orthogonal complement to the x-axis. The plane defined by the x and y axis shall be co-planar to the xy plane of the local placement of the _IfcGrid_.

The direction of the z-axis is the orientation of the cross product of the x-axis and the y-axis, i.e. the z-axis of the _IfcGridPlacement_ shall be co-linear to the z-axis of the local placement of the _IfcGrid_.

> NOTE The _PlacementLocation.OffsetDistances[3]_ and the _PlacementRefDirection.OffsetDistances[3]_ shall either not be assigned or should have the same z offset value.

The following figures/ show the usage of placement location and direction for an _IfcGridPlacement_.

# IfcLocalPlacement

An _IfcLocalPlacement_ defines the relative placement of a product in relation to the placement of another product or the absolute placement of a product within the geometric representation context of the project.
<!-- end of short definition -->

The _IfcLocalPlacement_ allows that an _IfcProduct_ can be placed by this _IfcLocalPlacement_ (through the attribute_ObjectPlacement_) within the local coordinate system of the object placement of another _IfcProduct_, which is referenced by the _PlacementRelTo_. Rules to prevent cyclic relative placements have to be introduced on the application level.

If the _PlacementRelTo_ is not given, then the _IfcProduct_ is placed absolutely within the world coordinate system.

The following conventions shall apply as default relative positions if the relative placement is used. The conventions are given for all five direct subtypes of _IfcProduct_, the _IfcSpatialStructureElement_, _IfcElement_, _IfcAnnotation_, _IfcGrid_, _IfcPort_. More detailed placement information is given at the level of subtypes of those five types mentioned.

* For the subtypes of _IfcSpatialStructureElement_ the following conventions apply
  * _IfcSite_ shall be placed absolutely within the world coordinate system established by the geometric representation context of the _IfcProject_
  * _IfcFacility_ shall be placed relative to the local placement of _IfcSite_
  * _IfcFacilityPart_ shall be placed relative to the local placement of _IfcFacility_
* For _IfcGrid_ and _IfcAnnotation_ the convention applies that it shall be placed relative
  * to the local placement of its container, either _IfcSite_, _IfcBuilding_, or _IfcBuildingStorey_
    * it should be the same container element that is referenced by the _IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure_ containment relationship,
* For _IfcAlignment_ placed relative to the world coordinate system of _IfcProject_.
* For _IfcPort_ the convention applies that it shall be placed relative
  * to the local placement of the _IfcElement_ it belongs to
    * it should be the same element that is referenced by the _IfcRelConnectsPortToElement_ connection relationship,
* For _IfcElement_ the convention applies that it shall be placed relative:
  * to the local placement of its container, either _IfcSite_, _IfcFacility_, or _IfcFacilityPart_
    * it should be the same container element that is referenced by the _IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure_ containment relationship,
  * to the local placement of the _IfcElement_ to which it is tied by an element composition relationship
    * for features that are located relative to the main component (such as openings), as expressed by _IfcRelVoidsElement_, _IfcRelProjectsElement_ and _IfcRelAdheresToElement_;
    * for elements that fill an opening (such as doors or windows), as expressed by _IfcRelFillsElement_;

# IfcObjectPlacement

_IfcObjectPlacement_ is an abstract supertype for the special types defining the object coordinate system. The _IfcObjectPlacement_ has to be provided for each product that has a shape representation.

The object placement can be given:

* absolute: by an axis2 placement, relative to the world coordinate system,
* relative: by an axis2 placement, relative to the object placement of another product,
* by grid reference: by the virtual intersection and reference direction given by two axes of a design grid,
* linear placement: by distance along a curve, with possible offsets.

In any case the object placement has to unambiguously define the object coordinate system as either two-dimensional axis placement (_IfcAxis2Placement2D_) or three-dimensional axis placement (_IfcAxis2Placement3D_). The axis placement may have to be calculated.

# IfcVirtualGridIntersection

_IfcVirtualGridIntersection_ defines the derived location of the intersection between two grid axes. Offset values may be given to set an offset distance to the grid axis for the calculation of the virtual grid intersection.
<!-- end of short definition -->

The two intersecting axes (_IntersectingAxes_) define the intersection point, which exact location (in terms of the Cartesian point representing the intersection) has to be calculated from the geometric representation of the two participating curves.

> NOTE The _IfcGrid_ local placement, that can be provided relative to the local placement of another spatial structure element, has to be taken into account for calculating the absolute placement of the _IfcVirtualGridIntersection_. Where rules and informal rules ensure, that the _IntersectingAxes_ belong to the same _IfcGrid_

Offset values may be given (_OffsetDistances_). If given, the position within the list of _OffsetDistances_ corresponds with the position within the list of _IntersectingAxes_. Therefore:

* _OffsetDistances[1]_ sets the offset to _IntersectingAxes[1]_,
* _OffsetDistances[2]_ sets the offset to _IntersectingAxes[2]_, and
* _OffsetDistances[3]_ sets the offset to the virtual intersection in direction of the orientation of the cross product of _IntersectingAxes[1]_ and the orthogonal complement of the _IntersectingAxes[1]_ (which is the positive or negative direction of the z axis of the design grid position).

The following figures/ explain the usage of the _OffsetDistances_ and _IntersectingAxes_ attributes.

![2D offsets](../../../../figures/ifcvirtualgridintersection-layout1.gif)

Figure 1 — Virtual grid intersection with two offsets

Figure 1 illustrates two offset distances given where the virtual intersection is defined in the xy plane of the grid axis placement.

![3D offsets](../../../../figures/ifcvirtualgridintersection-layout2.gif)

Figure 2 — Virtual grid intersection with three offsets

Figure 2 illustrates three offset distances given where the virtual intersection is defined by an offset (in direction of the z-axis of the design grid placement) to the virtual intersection in the xy plane of the grid axis placement.

The distance of the offset curve (_OffsetDistances[n]_) is measured from the basis curve. The distance may be positive, negative or zero. A positive value of distance defines an offset in the direction which is normal to the curve in the sense of an anti-clockwise rotation through 90 degrees from the tangent vector T at the given point. (This is in the direction of orthogonal complement(T).) This can be reverted by the _SameSense_ attribute at _IfcGridAxis_ which may switch the sense of the _AxisCurve_.

![offset direction](../../../../figures/ifcvirtualgridintersection-offset1.gif)

Figure 3 — Virtual grid intersection negative offset

Figure 3 illustrates an example of a negative offset where the figure shows the side of the offset.

 * <em>IntersectingAxes[1].AxisCurve</em> is an <em>IfcTrimmedCurve</em> with an <em>IfcCircle</em> as <em>BasisCurve</em> and <em>SenseAgreement</em> = TRUE.
 * <em>IntersectingAxes[1].SameSense</em> = TRUE.
 * <em>OffsetDistances[1]</em> is a negative length measure

**Informal Propositions**

1. Both, _IntersectingAxes[1]_ and _IntersectingAxes[2]_ shall be two _IfcGridAxis_ defined by the same _IfcGrid_.
2. _IntersectingAxes[1]_ and _IntersectingAxes[2]_ shall not be part of the same row of grid axes, i.e. both shall not be within the same set of _IfcGrid.UAxes_ or _IfcGrid.VAxes_ of the corresponding _IfcGrid_.

## Attributes

### IntersectingAxes
Two grid axes which intersects at exactly one intersection (see also informal proposition at IfcGrid). If attribute OffsetDistances is omitted, the intersection defines the placement or ref direction of a grid placement directly. If OffsetDistances are given, the intersection is defined by the offset curves to the grid axes.

IfcGeometricConstraintResource
==============================

The schema _IfcGeometricConstraintResource_ defines the resources used to determine the placement of the shape representation of a product within the geometric representation context of a project. It also contains resource definitions to be assigned to product connectivity definitions to determine the connection geometry constraints between those products.

The primary application of this resource is to:

* determine the object placement used for the shape representation of the object
* determine the constraints applied to the connectivity between two shapes of objects

#### 8.7.1.1 Placement
The placement of an product's shape is given by the _IfcObjectPlacement_, used by the attribute _ObjectPlacement_ of _IfcProduct_. The object placement defines the local object coordinate system in which all shape representations of that product are defined. It is given either as

* absolute placement,
    * the absolute placement is specified by using _IfcLocalPlacement_ and omitting the _PlacementRelTo_ attribute;
* relative placement,
    * the relative placement is specified by using _IfcLocalPlacement_ and pointing the _PlacementRelTo_ attribute to an _IfcObjectPlacement_ used in another _IfcProduct_ instance;
* placement relative to a grid,
    * the placement relative to a grid is specified by using _IfcGridPlacement_ pointing to one (or two) virtual intersections of _IfcGridAxis_. If two virtual intersections are references, than the second virtual intersections specifies the orientation of the object placement. Alternatively the direction can also be provided explicitly by IfcDirection.

> NOTE  When using relative placement the shape representation of each product is defined in the local object coordinate system provided by _ObjectPlacement_. That local object coordinate system is defined relative to the object coordinate system referred to by _PlacementRelTo_ which may be a relative placement as well. Finally the _ObjectPlacement_ not having an _PlacementRelTo_ attribute defined the transformation into the global coordinate system. The transformation of the current coordinate system into the parent coordinate systems have to be applied in that order.

#### 8.7.1.2 Connection geometry
The connection geometry defines the connectivity between the shapes of two products. The constraint can be defined by geometric representation items:

* point
* curve
* surface
* solid

or by topological representation items with associated geometry:

* vertex point
* edge curve
* face surface
* closed shell

As a special type of point connection includes the provision to express an eccentricity, i.e. a physical distance between the two points involved in the connection.

# IfcAlignmentCantSegmentTypeEnum

The IfcAlignmentCantSegmentTypeEnum indicates the type of a segment of a cant alignment segment (IfcAlignmentCantSegment).
<!-- end of short definition -->

Cant is defined as the amount by which one running rail is raised above the other running rail, in a track cross section.
>NOTE Definition according to EN 13803/2017

For 3D modeling both the cant value and the cant angle (bank angle, lateral angle, cross slope angle) are relevant.

The relation between cant value **D**, Railhead distance **b** and cant angle **ψ** is shown below.

$$ \displaylines {
\psi = \arcsin \frac{D}{b} \\\\
\sin \psi \approx \psi \approx \tan \psi
} $$

>NOTE in contemporary track engineering ψ is approximated by sinus of ψ or tangens of ψ very often.



| Variation of Cant | Segmenttype    | Enumeration Values |
|:----|:------------------|:----------|
| 0 | both rails without relative elevation    | CONSTANTCANT |
| constant in the complete segment, <> 0 | elevated rail | CONSTANTCANT |
| variation along the segment | Transition with linear cant variation | LINEARTRANSITION  |
| variation along the segment | Transition with non-linear cant variation | HELMERTCURVE, BLOSSCURVE, COSINECURVE, SINECURVE, VIENNESEBEND |

### Cant variation in high performance transition bends

While for combinations of horizontal clothoids and linear cant transitions the extension along the base line differs in some cases, curvature transition and cant transition for high performance horizontal transition bends are expected to have the same start position and end position. In some regulations the same linear extension requirement is mandatory for high performance transition bends.

Whether the cant variation is defined by the same base formula as the curvature of the corresponding horizontal high performance transition bend or by a linear ramp also might differ between regulations.




### Used Symbols and their meaning

| Symbol | meaning | Unit, value range |

# IfcAlignmentHorizontalSegmentTypeEnum

The IfcAlignmentHorizontalSegmentTypeEnum indicates the type of a segment of a horizontal alignment segment (IfcAlignmentHorizontalSegment). Horizontal segments can be viewed from a geometric perspective and from a kinematic perspective. In recent times the kinematic perspective gained importance. The enumerations are detailed according to this development especially in modern track design.
<!-- end of short definition -->

**Kinematic perspective on horizontal alignment segments**

The central parameter of the kinematic perspective is lateral acceleration of the vehicle induced by change of direction while driving. In the horizontal layout this is the represented by the curvature of the segment. According to the curvature value the following categorization can be made:

| Curvature | Segmenttype    | Enumeration Values |
|:----|:------------------|:----------|
| 0 | straight line    | LINE |
| constant in the complete segment, <> 0 | Circular arc | CIRCULARARC |
| variation along the segment | Transition with linear curvature variation | CLOTHOID, CUBIC |
| variation along the segment | Transition with non-linear curvature variation | HELMERTCURVE, BLOSSCURVE, COSINECURVE, SINECURVE, VIENNESEBEND |


**Geometric perspective on horizontal alignment segments**



The traditional view is denoted by the geometric perspective in the context of the business terminology related IfcAlignment documentation. Before the availability of modern computers alignment design was performed using "traditional" drawing techniques. In the first phase of computerization this origin led to a representation in the x,y space first and a check of safety related properties in a second step. This can still be seen in regulations which have been put into effect 1980 or earlier. Of course designs which have been produced on basis of these regulations reflect the "good enough" attitude in the precision of the documentation.

In a later phase an increasing importance of the kinematic perspective can be observed. Here precise control of the lateral acceleration (horizontal and cant layout) and vertical acceleration (vertical layout) became prevalent. Designers started to use high performance transition bends especially in high speed scenarios. In the kinematic perspective precise curvature fitting between consecutive segments needs to be better than in the "good enough" approach of traditional geometric perspective. Central terms are e.g. "jerks", "theoretical cant" or "cant deficiency".

**Generic calculation of intrinsic x, y-coordinates for a given curvature**

For each horizontal alignment segment with a known curvature formula a generic method to calculate segment intrinsic coordinates exists.

$$\displaylines{ \varphi(s) = \int d \varphi = \int \kappa(s) \ d s \\\\
x(s) = \int cos \ \varphi(s) \ d s = \int cos( \int \kappa(s) \ d s \ ) d s \\\\
y(s) = \int sin \ \varphi(s) \ d s = \int \sin( \int \kappa(s) \ d s\ ) d s }$$

> NOTE While it is possible to apply the generic calculation also for trivial cases like LINE or CIRCULARARC it is much more efficient to use available formulas.

**Word of warning**

"Good enough" traditional designs have to be carefully checked before being included into a high precision 3D model. Intermediate corrections might be necessary. Fortunately the clothoid works very well with comparable documentation quality both in the classic geometric perspective and in the more recent kinematic perspective. Fortunately the vast majority of horizontal transition bends are designed and implemented as clothoids.

**Recommendation**

Check the relevant regulations for the network in question. Alignment designs as such are very stable over the lifetime of the road or track. Especially for old designs quality and precision of available documentation has to be checked very carefully. A clear understanding of limitations should be established before implementing automated data flows between high precision BIM environments and legacy documentation systems. This applies both to legacy, central databases and to legacy, individual documents.

**Terminology**

**Intrinsic coordinate, intrinisc coordinate system of an alignment segment:**

The origin of an intrinsic coordinate system is the start of the segment. The direction of the positive x-axis is the start direction of the segments.

## Items

### LINE
In the geometry perspective it denotes a straight connection between two points. In the dynamic perspective, it denotes a segment with a curvature with a value of 0. This means that no lateral acceleration acts on the moving vehicle.

**Base formula (Curvature) **

$$ \kappa=0 $$

### CIRCULARARC
In the geometric perspective, it denotes a connection between two points that follows a circular path. In the dynamic perspective, it denotes a segment with constant lateral acceleration on the moving vehicle, i.e. constant curvature.

**Base formula (Curvature) **

$$ \kappa = const, \kappa <> 0 $$

### CLOTHOID
In the geometric perspective, a clothoid denotes a connection between two points where the radius of curvature changes along the segment at a constant rate. The clothoid was an early achievement of geometry, also known as Euler's spiral or Cornu's spiral. It became very popular in road and rail design even before the widespread availability of computers because of the availability of tabulations of the normalized clothoid. Proper application of the so called clothoid constant provided fast solutions for all relevant parameters necessary to integrate clothoid segments between two consecutive segments with constant curvature. In most cases the clothoid smooths the curvature between a straight line and a circular arc. <br/>

In the dynamic perspective, it denotes a segment with constant rate of lateral acceleration change induced by the curvature. The kinematic properties of the clothoid both reduce the exerted forces on the track by a train, improve the travel experience of train passengers and also reduce the stress of a car driver by avoiding sudden movements of the steering wheel.<br>

The kinematic advantages of the clothoid as a smoothing segment are true also for all the other transition bends currently in use.

**Base formula (Curvature)**

$$ \displaylines{ \xi = \frac{s}{L} \\\\
\kappa(s) = \kappa_{1} + \xi \Delta \kappa }$$

### CUBIC
In IFC CUBIC denotes a transition segment where x and y coordinates obey a cubic formula.

**General formula**

$$ y = a \cdot x^3 + b \cdot x^2 + c \cdot x + d $$

It was discovered very early that setting **a** to "1 / 6RL" and **b**, **c** and **d** to 0 yields a good enough approximation of the clothoid in many situations.

**Cubic formula for alignment**

$$ y = \frac{x^3}{6 \cdot R \cdot L} $$

Since the manual computation of cubics was considerable easier compared to the theoretically sound clothoid, cubic transitions became very popular as "good enough" replacement curves.

Cubic transition bends can still be found in many legacy alignments based on earlier design regulations. There also exist regulations containing cubic transitions for new designs.

It is obvious that simple approximations cannot fulfil all requirements for a kinematically correct track design. For example, the requirement of tangential continuity has often been neglected in favour of lower design costs by using sufficiently good cubic curves.

The cubic is known in two variants as **Cubic Parabola** or **Cubic Spiral** setting either the sinus or the cosinus of the deflection angle to 0.

### HELMERTCURVE
The Helmert curve or Helmert transition is an early example of a high performance transition bend. It is now widely accepted in relevant science and engineering that the linear change of the clothoid induces unwanted kinematic influences to a running train at speeds higher than 125 km/h.

In the geometry perspective the Helmert segment is the assembly of two parts of same length which mirror the same change in radius of curvature. A rough approximation is known as the biquadratic parabola.

>NOTE also referred to as Schramm curve.

**Base formula (Curvature)**

$$ \displaylines{
  \xi = \frac{s}{L} \\\\
  \text{First half: } \kappa(s) = \kappa_{1} + 2\xi^2 \Delta \kappa \\\\
  \text{Second half: } \kappa(s) = \kappa_{1} + ( 1 - 2 (1 - \xi)^2) \Delta \kappa
} $$

### BLOSSCURVE
The Bloss transition is a more recent form of a high performance transition bend. Proposed in 1936. it is now in use in several railway networks. There is no established rough geometric approximation.

>NOTE Further reading: Constantin Ciobanu, BLOSS TRANSITION – A SHORT DESIGN GUIDE

**Base formula (Curvature)**

$$ \displaylines{
  \xi = \frac{s}{L} \\\\
  \kappa(s) = \kappa_{1} + (3 - 2\xi) \  \xi^2 \ \Delta \kappa
} $$

### COSINECURVE
Cosine transition. The cosine transition was already discussed in 1868. Width the advent of high-speed rail it was applied in production designs. It is e.g. installed on Japanese high speed lines

**Base formula (Curvature)**

$$ \displaylines{
  \xi = \frac{s}{L} \\\\
  \kappa(s) = \kappa_{1} + \frac{1}{2}(1- cos(\pi\xi) \ ) \Delta \kappa
} $$

### SINECURVE
Sine transition or sinusoidal transition was suggested 1937. The curvature function is built up of one period of a sine function. The sine curve is characterised by particularly advantageous smoothing properties at the end points. Compared to the clothoid, it is twice as long.

>NOTE also referred to as Klein curve.

**Base formula (Curvature)**

$$ \displaylines{
  \xi = \frac{s}{L} \\\\
  \kappa(s) = \kappa_{1} + ( \xi - \frac{1}{2\pi}sin(2\pi\xi) \ ) \Delta \kappa
} $$

### VIENNESEBEND
The Viennese Bend (R) is an innovative track geometry transition element. Instead of analyzing the vehicle movement at the track plane the optimization efforts target a gravity center line at a defined height above the rails.

As a consequence the path of the horizontal alignment center line is also influenced by the cant layout. The first part of the curvature formula is assembled from the basic function like the other transition bends. The additional term contains the bank angle "ψ" and the gravity center line height "h" and is unique to the Viennes Bend (R). This term causes a small movement contrary to the main direction in the x,y layout.

**Curvature formula**

$$ \displaylines{
  \xi = \frac{s}{L} \\\\
  \psi(s) = \psi_1 + \Delta\psi \cdot \xi^4 \cdot (35-84\xi + 70\xi^2-20\xi^3) \\\\
  \kappa(s) = \kappa_{1} + ( \Delta \kappa \cdot \xi^2 \cdot (35-84\xi + 70\xi^2-20\xi^3) \\\\
  \hspace{3em}  -420 \cdot \frac{h \Delta\psi}{L^2} \cdot (1 - 4\xi + 5\xi^2 - 2\xi^3)) \cdot \xi^2
} $$

**References to EN 13803/2017**

EN 13803/2017 covers "Track alignment design parameters". As such it is not fully compatible with definitions for IFC Alignment. Therefore rail specific terms like track have been replaced with more general terms also applicable to road design.

Referenced content of EN 13803/2017 "Table 2 - Elements for vertical alignment" has been modified as follows:

**Vertical curve, parabola:** Derivative of gradient with respect to chainage is constant<br/>
**Generalized:** Derivative of gradient with respect to horizontal projection of alignment is constant

**Vertical curve, circular:** Derivative of vertical angle with respect to sloping length along the track is constant<br/>
**Generalized:** Derivative of vertical angle with respect to 3D arc length along the alignment is constant

EN13803 clause 3.5:
**Chainage**: longitudinal distance along the horizontal projection of the track centre line.

# IfcBoxedHalfSpace

The _IfcBoxedHalfSpace_ is used (as its supertype _IfcHalfSpaceSolid_) only within Boolean operations. It divides the domain into exactly two subsets, where the domain in question is that of the attribute _Enclosure_.
<!-- end of short definition -->

The purpose of the attribute _Enclosure_ is to provide a search box for the other operand in the Boolean operation. It shall be sufficiently large to fully enclose the resulting solid after the Boolean operation with the half space. It however does not alter the final result. The result of the Boolean operation would be the same, as if executed by the supertype _IfcHalfSpaceSolid_. See Figure 1 below.

![correct use of enclosure](../../../../figures/ifcboxedhalfspace_01.png "Figure 1 — Boxed half space operands")

The _IfcBoundingBox_ that provides the enclosure is given for the convenience of the receiving application to enable the use of size box comparison for efficiency (for example, to check first whether size boxes intersect, if not no calculations has to be done to check whether the solids of the entities intersect).

An _IfcCsgSolid_ is the representation of a 3D shape using constructive solid geometry model. It is represented by a single 3D CSG primitive, or as a result of a Boolean operation. The operants of a Boolean operation can be Boolean operations themselves forming a CSG tree. The following volumes can be parts of the CSG tree:

* Boundary representation models, such as _IfcFacetedBrep_, _IfcFacetedBrepWithVoids_,
* Closed tessellated representation models, such as _IfcPolygonalFaceSet_, _IfcTriangulatedFaceSet_,

(There may be further Boolean results within the tree as operands). The significance of a CSG solid entity is that the solid defined by the associated tree is thus identified as a significant object itself, and in this way it is distinguished from other Boolean result entities representing intermediate results during the construction process.

An abstract entity defining common information about a type of swept area solid which is the result of sweeping an area along a Directrix. The swept area is provided by a subtype of IfcProfileDef. The profile is placed by an implicit cartesian transformation operator at the start point of the sweep, where the profile normal agrees to the tangent of the directrix at this point. The direction of profile's x-axis is specialized by the subtypes of IfcDirectrixCurveSweptAreaSolid.

The start of the sweeping operation is at the StartParam, the parameter value is provided based on the curve parameterization. If no StartParam is provided the start defaults to the begin of the directrix.

# IfcExtrudedAreaSolidTapered

_IfcExtrudedAreaSolidTapered_ is defined by sweeping a cross section along a linear spine. The cross section may change along the sweep from the shape of the start cross section into the shape of the end cross section. The resulting solid is bounded by three or more faces: A start face, an end face (each defined by start and end planes and sections), and one or more lateral faces. Each lateral face is a ruled surface defined by a pair of corresponding edges of the start and end section.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> NOTE Given that the start and end section is provided by a polygon, the corresponding vertices of the start and end cross section are connected, forming a quadrilateral polygon between each pair of corresponding vertices. The surface defined by the bounding quadrilateral polygon is a ruled surface, that could be approximated by triangulation.

The linear spine is defined by:

* Start point: _SELF\IfcSweptAreaSolid.Position.Location_
* Direction: _SELF\IfcExtrudedAreaSolid.ExtrudedDirection_
* Distance: _SELF\IfcExtrudedAreaSolid.Depth_

The start cross section is defined by _SELF\IfcSweptAreaSolid.SweptArea_:

* A bounded planar surface lying in the XY plane of the position coordinate system defined by _SELF\IfcSweptAreaSolid.Position.P[1]_ and _SELF\IfcSweptAreaSolid.Position.P[2]_
* The linear spine starts at the plane of the start cross section. The spine is not necessarily perpendicular to the plane.

The end cross section is defined by _EndSweptArea_:

* A bounded planar surface lying in the XY plane of the position coordinate system defined by translating the start position coordinates provided by _SELF\IfcSweptAreaSolid.Position_ along the spine direction by the spine distance. The plane of the end cross section is coplanar to the plane of the start cross section.
*
  * The end cross section is topologically similar to the start cross section (i.e. having the same number of vertices and edges).
  * The end cross section can either be defined by the same parametric profile using different parameter values, or by a 2D Cartesian transformation of the start profile within the end cross section plane.

In case of two parameterized profiles the shape is constructed as follows:

* The end profile, defined by a cross section based on the same profile parameterization as the start profile, is translated by the spine distance along the spine direction.
* It may be shifted within the XY plane of the end position coordinate system and may be twisted using the rotation parameter.
* The shift and rotation parameter are provided by the end cross section being of type _IfcParameterizedProfileDef_, where
  * Shift is _EndSweptArea\IfcParameterizedProfileDef.Position.Location_
  * Rotation is _EndSweptArea\IfcParameterizedProfileDef.Position.RefDirection_
* Corresponding vertices of the start and end cross section are connected. Lateral faces are constructed as ruled surfaces between corresponding edges of start and end cross section.

In case of Cartesian transformation of the start cross section the shape is constructed as follows:

* The cross section curve, which starts as a curve in the XY plane of the position coordinate system, is first scaled about the origin by the scale parameter. It is then translated by the spine distance along the spine direction. It maybe twisted by using the rotation parameter.
* The scale and rotation parameter are provided by the end cross section being of type _IfcDerivedProfileDef_, where
  * Scale is _EndSweptArea\IfcDerivedProfileDef.Operator.Scale_
  * Rotation is _EndSweptArea\IfcDerivedProfileDef.Operator.Axis1_
* Corresponding vertices of the start and end cross section are connected. Lateral faces are constructed as ruled surfaces between corresponding edges of start and end cross section.

# IfcFixedReferenceSweptAreaSolid

An _IfcFixedReferenceSweptAreaSolid_ is a type of swept area solid which is the result of sweeping an area along a _Directrix_. The swept area is provided by a subtype of _IfcProfileDef_. The profile is placed by an implicit cartesian transformation operator at the start point of the sweep, where the profile normal agrees to the start tangent of the directrix at this point, and the profile's x-axis agrees to the orthogonal projection of the _FixedReference_ direction within the plane of start tangent and _Fixed_Reference_. The orientation of the curve during the sweeping operation is controlled by the _FixedReference_ direction.
<!-- end of short definition -->

The _SweptArea_ is swept along the _Directrix_ in such a way that the origin of the local coordinate system used to define the _SweptArea_ is on the _Directrix_ and the local x-axis is in the direction of the projection of _FixedReference_ onto the normal plane to the directrix at this point. The resulting solid has the property that the cross section of the surface by the normal plane to the _Directrix_ at any point is a copy of the _SweptArea_. The resulting swept solid is placed by the _Position_ coordinate system.

The _Directrix_ and the _ReferenceSurface_ are positioned within the object coordinate system. The start of the sweeping operation is at the _StartParam_, being either the parameter value based on the curve parameterization, or by a length measured along the directrix from its beginning. If no _StartParam_ is provided the start defaults to the begin of the directrix. The end of the sweeping operation is at the _EndParam_, being either the parameter value based on the curve parameterization, or by a length measured along the directrix from its beginning. If no _EndParam_ is provided the end defaults to the end of the directrix.

> NOTE The _StartParam_ and the _EndParam_, if provided as a parameter value, are not normalized by default, they depend upon the parameterization of the curve. However using the _IfcReparametrisedCompositeCurveSegment_ within an _IfcCompositeCurve_ as the directrix allows to explicitly reparameterize the underlying sweeping curve.

> NOTE In the case of a curve composed of _IfcCurveSegment_, the _IfcSweptAreaSolid_ _Position_ is dependent on the _IfcCurveSegment_ _StartPlacement_ and the type of _BasisCurve_ which defines the _name-function_ between the start and end (explicitly defined as the start point of the next segment) points of the segment

> EXAMPLE The reference surface is any surface (plane, cylindric, composite) situated in 3D space and positioned in the object coordinate system. In many cases, it is a surface of extrusion. The directrix lies on the surface, often defined as a p-curve at this reference surface. At any point of the directrix, a plane can be constructed. The origin of the position coordinate system lies at the directrix. The Axis3 (the z-axis, or normal) of the position coordinate system is identical to the tangent of the directrix at this point, the Axis1 (the x axis, or u) of the position coordinate system is identical to the _FixedReference_ direction. The Axis2 (the y axis, or v) is constructed. In this case the resulting swept solid is not repositioned.

The orientation of the _SweptArea_ as it sweeps along the _Directrix_ is precisely defined by a _CartesianTransformationOperator3d_ with attributes:

* _LocalOrigin_ as point (0; 0; 0),
* _Axis1_ as the orthogonal projection of the _FixedReference_ onto the normal plane defined by _Axis3_.
* _Axis3_ as the direction of the tangent vector **t** at the point of the _Directrix_ with parameter **u**.

The remaining attributes are defaulted to define a corresponding transformation matrix **T(u)**, which varies with the _Directrix_ parameter **u**.

# IfcPolygonalBoundedHalfSpace

The polygonal bounded half space is a special subtype of a half space solid, where the material of the half space used in Boolean expressions is bounded by a two-dimensional boundary. The base surface of the half space is positioned by its normal relative to the object coordinate system (as defined at the supertype _IfcHalfSpaceSolid_), and its boundary (with straight and arc segments) is defined in the XY plane of the position coordinate system established by the _Position_ attribute, the subtraction body is extruded perpendicular to the XY plane of the position coordinate system, that is, into the direction of the positive Z axis defined by the _Position_ attribute.
<!-- end of short definition -->

The boundary is defined by a 2 dimensional polyline (or 2 dimensional composite curve, consisting of straight segments and circular arc segments, or indexed poly curve) within the XY plane of the position coordinate system. The side of the surface which is in the half space is determined by the surface normal and the agreement flag. If the agreement flag is TRUE, then the subset is the one the normal points away from. If the agreement flag is FALSE, then the subset is the one the normal points into.

> NOTE A polygonal bounded half space is not a subtype of _IfcSolidModel_, half space solids are only useful as operands in Boolean expressions. The term _IfcPolygonalBoundedHalfSpace_ was coined when only curves of type _IfcPolyline_ were allowed as boundary definitions.

Figure 1 illustrates a polygonal bounded half space.

This coordinate system is relative to the object coordinate system. The extrusion direction of the subtraction body is the positive Z axis.
 * Red coordinates indicate the normal of the plane. It is provided by the <em>BaseSurface</em> (<em>IfcSurface.Position</em>). This normal is also relative to the object coordinate system.

The polygonal bounded half space is used to limit the volume of the half space in Boolean difference expressions. Only the part that is defined by a theoretical intersection between the half space solid and an extruded area solid, defined by extruding the polygonal boundary, is used for Boolean expressions.

The _PolygonalBoundary_ defines the 2D polyline which bounds the effectiveness of the half space in Boolean expressions. The _BaseSurface_ is defined by a plane, and the normal of the plane together with the _AgreementFlag_ defines the side of the material of the half space.

# IfcPolygonalFaceSet

The _IfcPolygonalFaceSet_ is a tessellated face set with all faces being bound by polygons. The planar faces are constructed by implicit polylines defined by three or more Cartesian points. Each planar face is defined by an instance of _IfcIndexedPolygonalFace_, or in case of faces with inner loops by _IfcIndexedPolygonalFaceWithVoids_.
<!-- end of short definition -->

Depending on the value of the inherited attribute _Closed_ the instance of _IfcPolygonalFaceSet_ represents:

* if TRUE, a boundary representation (or B-rep);
* if FALSE, a face based surface representation.

The attribute _Faces_ refers to a list of _IfcIndexedPolygonalFace_'s having an one-based _CoordIndex_ that provides three or more indices. If the face has inner loops, the _IfcIndexedPolygonalFaceWithVoids_ has a two-dimensional, one-based list, where:
* the first dimension of the two-dimensional list addresses the list of inner loops;
* the second dimension of the two-dimensional list provides three or more indices each being a vertex of the planar polygon representing the inner loop.

Depending on the provision of _PnIndex_ the indices point either directly into the _IfcCartesianPointList3D_ referenced by _Coordinates_ defined at the supertype _IfcTessellatedFaceSet_, or they point into the _PnIndex_ where the integer values at that position provides the location of the coordinate values within the _IfcCartesianPointList3D_. See Figure 1 for the handling of point index.

# IfcSectionedSolidHorizontal

An _IfcSectionedSolidHorizontal_ is a solid model constructed by sweeping potentially varying cross sections along a curve horizontally.
<!-- end of short definition -->

The solid is generated by sweeping the _CrossSections_ between _CrossSectionPositions_ with linear interpolation between profile points with the same tag along the directrix. The profile normal is derived from the associated _IfcAxis2PlacementLinear_, not necessarily the tangent of the _Directrix_. The profile X axis is the direction of _RefDirection_ from _IfcAxis2PlacementLinear_, and the profile Y axis is the direction of _Axis_.

For sections having cross-section rotated according to a single super-elevation, _IfcDerivedProfileDef_ may be used to indicate such rotation with each _ParentProfile_ referring to the same underlying profile. For sections having cross-section transformed according to multiple super-elevations with points varying independently, each profile may be of a different instance but of same type (e.g. _IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef_), and may optionally have cross section points associated to string lines ("guide curves") by matching labels using _IfcIndexedPolyCurve_ with _IfcCartesianPointList2D.TagList_.

Figure 1 illustrates four girders of a bridge having a constant parameterized profile, two guardrails having a constant arbitrary profile (one of them mirrored), and a bridge deck having a variable arbitrary profile.

# IfcSectionedSpine

An _IfcSectionedSpine_ is a representation of the shape of a three dimensional object composed by a number of planar cross sections, and a spine curve.

# IfcSurfaceCurveSweptAreaSolid

The _IfcSurfaceCurveSweptAreaSolid_ is the result of sweeping an area along a directrix that lies on a reference surface. The swept area is provided by a subtype of _IfcProfileDef_. The profile is placed by an implicit cartesian transformation operator at the start point of the sweep, where the profile normal agrees to the tangent of the directrix at this point, and the profile''s x-axis agrees to the surface normal. At any point along the directrix, the swept profile origin lies on the directrix, the profile''s normal points towards the tangent of the directrix, and the profile''s x-axis is identical to the surface normal at this point.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> NOTE The profile area''s normal has to be identical to the tangent of the directrix at any given point. In case of a directrix having a linear segment at the start point, the segment has to be perpendicular to the profile at start.

The _Directrix_ and the _ReferenceSurface_ are positioned within the object coordinate system. The start of the sweeping operation is at the _StartParam_, the parameter value is provided based on the curve parameterization. If no _StartParam_ is provided the start defaults to the begin of the directrix. The end of the sweeping operation is at the _EndParam_, the parameter value is provided based on the curve parameterization. If no _EndParam_ is provided the end defaults to the end of the directrix. The geometric shape of the solid is not dependent upon the curve parameterization; the volume depends upon the area swept and the length of the _Directrix_.

> NOTE The _StartParam_ and the _EndParam_ are not normalized by default, they depend upon the parameterization of the curve. However using the _IfcReparametrisedCompositeCurveSegment_ within an _IfcCompositeCurve_ as the directrix allows to explicitly reparameterize the underlying sweeping curve. In case of a closed curve, such as _IfcCircle_ or _IfcEllipse_, as the directrix, _StartParam_ and the _EndParam_ shall not exceed the parametric range, they shall not be > 360°.

> EXAMPLE The reference surface is any surface (plane, cylindric, composite) situated in 3D space and positioned in the object coordinate system. In most cases, it is a plane or a surface of extrusion. The directrix lies on the surface, in case of a plane it might be defined as a polyline or composite curve, in case of a cylindrical or other non-planer reference surface it might often be defined as a p-curve on this reference surface.

At any point of the directrix, a plane can be constructed. The origin of the position coordinate system of the implicit plane lies at the directrix. The Axis3 (the z-axis, or normal) of the position coordinate system is identical to the tangent of the directrix at this point, the Axis1 (the x axis, or u) of the position coordinate system is identical to the normal of the reference surface at this point. The Axis2 (the y axis, or v) is constructed.

The resulting body of the swept solid is not repositioned if the inherited _Position_ attribute is omitted. Otherwise the coordinate system established by the _Position_ attribute is used to reposition the body relative to the object coordinate system.

# IfcTessellatedFaceSet

The _IfcTessellatedFaceSet_ is a boundary representation topological model limited to planar faces and straight edges. It may represent an approximation of an analytical surface or solid that may be provided in addition to its tessellation as a separate shape representation. The _IfcTessellatedFaceSet_ provides a compact data representation of an connected face set using indices into ordered lists of vertices, normals, colours, and texture maps.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> NOTE The compact representation has been chosen to enable small data sets despite potentially large sets of faces, edges and vertices needed to represent tessellations of analytical surfaces and solids, and despite large sets of colour and texture information to annotate the tessellated faces.

The _IfcTessellatedFaceSet_ is an abstract supertype of tessellated face sets each imposing specific constraints on face generation for tessellation, such as triangulation (with or without strip and fans), or quadrilaterals, or polygonal faces (with or without inner loops).

> NOTE Not all different constraints on face sets are included as specific subtypes in this release of the specification.

The following attributes apply to all subtypes:

* The _Coordinates_ are the ordered list of Cartesian points representing the vertices of the tessellated item. An index list, defined at the level of subtypes, uses the points, identified by index position, to construct the polylines that represent the faces.
* The _HasColours_ inverse relation provides an indexed colour map with an corresponding list of indices providing a colour for each face of the tessellated face set.
* The _HasTextures_ inverse relation provides an indexed texture map with an corresponding list of indices providing texture coordinates that map to the geometric coordinates of the polylines representing the faces.

Each face of the tessellated face set shall have:

* at least three non-coincident vertices;
* vertices that define a planar polygon;
* vertices that define a non-self-intersecting polygon.

> NOTE The definition of _IfcTessellatedFaceSet_ is based on the **indexedFaceSet** defined in ISO/IEC 19775-1

# IfcTriangulatedFaceSet

The _IfcTriangulatedFaceSet_ is a tessellated face set with all faces being bound by triangles. The faces are constructed by implicit polylines defined by three Cartesian points. Depending on the value of the inherited attribute _Closed_ the instance of _IfcTriangulatedFaceSet_ represents:

* if TRUE, a boundary representation (or B-rep);
* if FALSE, a face based surface representation.
<!-- end of short definition -->

The coordinates of each point are provided by a one-based index into an ordered list of Cartesian points provided by the two-dimensional list _CoordIndex_, where

* the first dimension of the two-dimensional list addresses the list of triangular faces;
* the second dimension of the two-dimensional list provides exactly three indices. Each index points to a Cartesian point being a vertex of the triangle.

Depending on the provision of _PnIndex_ the indices point either directly into the _IfcCartesianPointList3D_ referenced by _Coordinates_ defined at the supertype _IfcTessellatedFaceSet_, or they point into the _PnIndex_ where the integer values at that position provides the location of the coordinate values within the _IfcCartesianPointList3D_. See Figure 1 for the handling of point index.

![IfcTriangulatedFaceSet_01](../../../../figures/ifctriangulatedfaceset_03.png "Figure 1 — Use of _PnIndex_")

See Figure 2 for using the _IfcTriangulatedFaceSet_ without (as default) and with using the _PnIndex_.

![IfcTriangulatedFaceSet_02](../../../../figures/ifctriangulatedfaceset_01.png "Figure 2 — Triangulated face set")

Optionally normals can be provided. Only normals per vector are supported allowing for visually curved triangles when the three normals of the corresponding three vertices of a triangle are not co-linear to the normal of the triangular face. If they are identical, normals shall be omitted.

> NOTE In case of a body representation having triangular faces with curvature, different normals for all three vertices in context of this triangles are exported, describing the curvature for smooth visualisation. In case of triangular faces with no curvature, the three vertex-based normals are identical and could always be computed from the face. Therefore vertices should only be exported to support smooth visualisation by curvature of triangles. In case of faceted representation no vertices should be exported.

Normals are provided by the two-dimensional list _Normals_, where

* the first dimension of the two-dimensional list addresses the corresponding list of vertex indices of the triangular faces;
* the second dimension of the two-dimensional list provides exactly three real values to determine the direction of the normal at this vertex of the triangle.

The indices in the _CoordIndex_ point into the list of _Normals_. The indices of _CoordIndex_ are applied to both points, either directly directly, or via the _PnIndex_ and normals. See Figure 3 for handling of normals.

![IfcTriangulatedFaceSet_02](../../../../figures/ifctriangulatedfaceset_02.png "Figure 3 — Triangulated face set with normals")

> NOTE Using corresponding lists of points and normals allows to use only a single list of indices into both at the expense of having non-unique collections of vertices.

Figure 4 shows the use of _IfcTriangulatedFaceSet_ without annotation. The diagram of the _IfcTriangulatedFaceSet_ represents the indices and the ordered list into which the indices point. The index starts with 1 (indexed as 1 to N), if the greatest index in _CoordIndex_ in N, then the _IfcCartesianPointList_ shall have N lists of 3:3 coordinates.

The _IfcTriangulatedIrregularNetwork_ is a triangulated face set for representing horizontal surfaces (one unique Z coordinate for all X and Y coordinates within domain) with additional flags for each face indicating breaklines between faces or designation as a hole or void. Triangles shall be defined with vertices in counterclockwise order as viewing from above (following right-hand rule).
<!-- end of short definition -->

For visualization, applications should not display faces where flags are set as negative (either a hole, void, or possible future extension).

The flag _Void_ shall be used to indicate that faces are to be excluded without falling back on any other geometry. Such designation could be used for portions of a site beneath a building or other structure.

The flag _Hole_ shall be used to indicate that faces are to be excluded but may fall back on other geometry. Such designation could be used for portions of a proposed site that are to remain unchanged (conforming to an existing site that may also be defined)

For scenarios where multiple surfaces used as input are to be combined, any triangles marked _Void_ shall be retained as voids, while any triangles marked as _Hole_ shall be overridden if another surface has visible geometry defined within the same horizontal location.

IfcGeometricModelResource
=========================

The schema _IfcGeometricModelResource_ defines the resources used for geometric model representations. The primary application of this resource is for representation of the shape or geometric form of a product model.

The following is within the scope of the geometric model representation in the current version of the geometric model resource:

* data describing the precise geometric form of three-dimensional solid objects;
* constructive solid geometry (CSG) models;
* definition of half-spaces;
* creation of solid models by sweeping operations;
* manifold boundary representation (brep) models;
* surface models;
* tessellated models;
* geometric sets.



> NOTE  Many definitions of this schema are adapted from definitions defined within [ISO 10303-42](../content/bibliography.htm#iso-10303-42). The _IfcGeometricModelResource_ refers to the clause 6, "Geometric Model" of [ISO 10303-42](../content/bibliography.htm#iso-10303-42). The definitions of geometric and topological representation, when quoted from [ISO 10303-42](../content/bibliography.htm#iso-10303-42), are explicitly excluded from the copyright of this specification.

> REFERENCE  Definition according to ISO 10303-42

The constructive solid geometry models are represented by their component primitives and the sequence of Boolean operations (union, intersection, or difference) used in their construction. The entity which communicates the logical sequence of Boolean operations is the boolean result (_IfcBooleanResult_) which identifies an operator and two operands. Since the operands can themselves be Boolean results thus enabling nested operations. Swept solids and half-space solids are permissible Boolean operands. The swept solids are the solid of revolution and the solid of linear extrusion. The swept solids are obtained by extruding or sweeping a planar face which may contain holes. The half space solid is essentially defined as a semi-infinite solid on one side of a surface; it may be limited by a box domain.

> REFERENCE  Definition according to ISO 10303-42

Brep models are represented by the set of shells defining the exterior or interior boundaries. The faceted brep is restricted to represent breps in which all faces are planar and every loop is a poly loop. For such a solid this entity provides a more efficient form of representation. The shell based surface model, the face based surface model and the geometric set entities do not enforce the integrity checks of the manifold solid brep and can be used for the communication of incomplete models (including two-dimensional models).

# IfcBSplineSurface

The _IfcBSplineSurface_ is a general form of rational or polynomial parametric surface.
<!-- end of short definition -->

{ .extDef}
> NOTE Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992
> A b_spline_surface is a general form of rational or polynomial parametric surface which is represented by control points, basis functions, and possibly, weights. As with the corresponding curve entity it has some special subtypes where some of the data can be derived.

The symbology used here is:

Variable | Definition
--- | ---
<em>K</em>1 | upper_index_on_u_control_points
<em>K</em>2 | upper_index_on_v_control_points
<b>P</b><sub>ij</sub> | control_points
w<sub>ij</sub> | weights
<em>d</em>1 | u_degree
<em>d</em>2</td> | v_degree

The control points are ordered as: P<sub>00</sub>, P<sub>01</sub>, P<sub>02</sub>, ..., P<sub><em>K</em>1(<em>K</em>2-1)</sub>, P<sub><em>K</em>1<em>K</em>2</sub>

The weights, in the case of the rational subtype, are ordered similarly.

For each parameter, <em>s</em> = <em>u</em> or <em>v</em>, if <em>k</em> is the upper
index on the control points and <em>d</em> is the degree for <em>s</em>, the knot array is an array of (<em>k</em> +
<em>d</em> + 2) real numbers [s<sub>-d</sub>, ...., s<sub><em>k</em>+1</sub>], such that for all indices j in
[-<em>d</em>, <em>k</em>]; <em>s</em><sub><em>j</em></sub> ≤ <em>s</em><sub><em>j</em>+1</sub>. This array is
obtained from the appropriate u_knots or v_knots list by repeating each multiple knot according to the
multiplicity.<br>
<br>
N<sub><em>i</em></sub><sup><em>d</em></sup>, the <em>i</em>th normalised B-spline basis function of degree <em>d</em>,
is defined on the subset [<em>s</em><sub>i-<em>d</em></sub>, ...., <em>s</em><sub><em>i</em>+1</sub>] of this
array.

Let <em>L</em> denote the number of distinct values amongst the knots in the knot list;
<em>L</em> will be referred to as the ‘upper index on knots’. Let <em>m</em><sub><em>j</em></sub> denote
the multiplicity (i.e., number of repetitions) of the <em>j</em>th distinct knot value. Then:

![formula](../../../../figures/ifcbsplinecurve-math2.gif)

All knot multiplicities except the first and the last shall be in the range 1, ...., <em>d</em>; the first and last may have a maximum value of <em>d</em>+1. In evaluating the basis functions, a knot <em>u</em> of, e.g., multiplicity 3 is interpreted as a sequence <em>u</em>, <em>u</em>, <em>u</em>, in the knot array.

The surface form is used to identify specific quadric surface types (which shall have degree two), ruled surfaces and surfaces of revolution. As with the b-spline curve, the surface form is informational only and the spline data takes precedence.

The surface is to be interpreted as follows: In the polynomial case the surface is
given by the equation:

In the rational case the surface equation is:

# IfcCosineSpiral

*IfcCosineSpiral* is a type of spiral curve for which the curvature change is dependent on the cosine function.
<!-- end of short definition -->
The cosine spiral curve is parameterized by its curve length and for a given parameter \\(s\\), the heading angle \\(\theta(s)\\) and the curvature \\(\kappa(s)\\) are defined as follows. Here, \\(A_0\\) corresponds to the *ConstantTerm* and \\(A_1\\) to the *CosineTerm*.

**Heading Angle:**

The *Heading Angle* \\(\theta(s)\\) represents the orientation of the tangent to the curve at a given arc length. It indicates the direction in which the curve is "pointing" at that point. As you move along the curve, \\(\theta(s)\\) changes, showing how the curve’s direction evolves.

$$\theta(s) = \frac{1}{A_0} s \;+\; \frac{L}{\pi A_1} \sin\!\biggl(\frac{\pi}{L}s\biggr)$$

**Curvature:**

The *Curvature* \\(\kappa(s)\\) describes how quickly the heading angle changes with respect to the arc length \\(s\\). It reflects the "tightness" of the curve. Higher curvature values correspond to sharper bends, and lower curvature values correspond to straighter segments.

$$\kappa(s) = \frac{L}{A_0} \;+\; \frac{L}{A_1}\cos\!\biggl(\frac{\pi}{L}s\biggr)$$

The _IfcSegmentedReferenceCurve_ is a curve defined in the linear parameter space of its base curve that is set in the attribute _BaseCurve_. The base curve provides a basis for the positioning of the collection of _IfcCurveSegment_ occurrences. A deviating explicit position of a curve segment (_IfcCurveSegment_.Placement) from the axis of the base curve produces a superelevation i.e. depression or elevation from the axis of the base curve. The superelevation rate of change is directly proportionate to the curve segment parent curve curvature gradient equation (_IfcCurveSegment_._ParentCurve_) in the linear parameter space of the base curve. If no deviation in the position of the curve segment to the base curve axis is specified, the axes (Axis and RefDirection) directions of _IfcAxis2Placement_ are interpolated between the initial curve segment placement and the placement of the subsequent curve segment.

# IfcSineSpiral

*IfcSineSpiral* is a type of spiral curve for which the curvature change is dependent on the sine function.
<!-- end of short definition -->
The sine spiral curve is parameterized by its curve length and for a given parameter \\(s\\), the heading angle \\(\theta(s)\\) and the curvature \\(\kappa(s)\\) are defined as follows. Here, \\(A_0\\) corresponds to the *ConstantTerm*, \\(A_1\\) to the *LinearTerm*, and \\(A_2\\) to the *SineTerm*.

**Heading Angle:**

The *Heading Angle* \\(\theta(s)\\) represents the orientation of the tangent to the curve at a given arc length. It indicates the direction in which the curve is "pointing" at that point. By following changes in \\(\theta(s)\\) along the curve, one can understand how the curve rotates and changes direction as it progresses.


$$\theta(s) = \frac{1}{A_0} s \;+\; \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{A_1}{|A_1|}\right)\left(\frac{s}{|A_1|}\right)^2\;-\; \frac{L}{2\pi A_2}\biggl(\cos\bigl(\frac{2\pi}{L}s\bigr)-1\biggr)$$

**Curvature:**

The *Curvature* \\(\kappa(s)\\) describes how quickly the heading angle changes with respect to the arc length. In other words, curvature indicates how "tight" a curve is turning at any point. A larger curvature corresponds to a sharper bend, while a smaller curvature corresponds to a straighter segment of the curve.

$$  \kappa(s) = \frac{L}{A_0} \;+\; \frac{A_1}{|A_1|}\left(\frac{L}{|A_1|}\right)^2  \frac{s}{L} \;+\; \frac{L}{A_2}\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{L}s\right) $$

{ .extDef}
> NOTE Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992
> A surface curve is a type of curve, that is a curve on a surface. The curve is represented as a curve (curve_3d) in three-dimensional space and possibly as a curve, corresponding to a pcurve, in the two-dimensional parametric space of a surface. The ability of this curve to reference a list of 1 or 2 pcurves enables this entity to define either a curve on a single surface, or an intersection curve which has two distinct surface associations. A `seam' on a closed surface can also be represented by this entity; in this case each associated_geometry will be a pcurve lying on the same surface. Each pcurve shall be parametrised to have the same sense as curve_3d. The surface curve takes its parametrisation directly from either curve_3d or pcurve as indicated by the attribute master representation.

> NOTE Entity adapted from **surface_curve** defined in ISO 10303-42.

> HISTORY New entity in IFC4 Add2.

**Informal Propositions**

1. Where _Curve3D_ and one or two pcurves exist they shall represent the same mathematical point set. (i.e., they shall coincide geometrically but may differ in parametrisation.)
2. The _Curve3D_ and any associated pcurves shall agree with respect to their senses.

## Attributes

### Curve3D
The curve which is the three-dimensional representation of the surface curve.

### AssociatedGeometry
A list of one or two pcurves which define the surface or surfaces associated with the surface curve. Two elements in this list indicate that the curve has two surface associations which need not be two distinct surfaces. Being a pcurve, it also associates a basis curve in the parameter space of this surface as an alternative representation of the surface curve.

### MasterRepresentation
The <em<MasterRepresentation defines the curve used to determine the unique parametrisation of the _IfcSurfaceCurve_.
The master_representation takes one of the values _Curve3D_, _PCurve_S1_ or _PCurve_S2_ to indicate a preference for the 3D curve, or the first or second pcurve, in the associated geometry list, respectively. Multiple representations provide the ability to communicate data in more than one form, even though the data is expected to be geometrically identical.

>NOTE The master representation attribute acknowledges the impracticality of ensuring that multiple forms are indeed identical and allows the indication of a preferred form. This would probably be determined by the creator of the data. All characteristics, such as parametrisation, domain, and results of evaluation, for an entity having multiple representations, are derived from the master representation. Any use of the other representations is a compromise for practical considerations.

### BasisSurface

# IfcTrimmedCurve

An _IfcTrimmedCurve_ is a bounded curve that is trimmed at both ends. The trimming points may be provided by a Cartesian point or by a parameter value, based on the parameterization of the _BasisCurve_. The _SenseAgreement_ attribute indicates whether the direction of the _IfcTrimmedCurve_ agrees with or is opposed to the direction of the _BasisCurve_.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> NOTE In case of the _BasisCurve_ being a closed curve, such as an _IfcCircle_ or _IfcEllipse_, the _SenseAgreement_ affects the geometric shape of the _IfcTrimmedCurve_.

![curve parameterization](../../../../figures/ifctrimmedcurve_parameterization.png "Figure 1 — Trimmed curve parameterization")

Figure 1 shows the four arcs (dashed blue and green lines with arrow showing different orientations) that can be defined by the same _BasisCurve_ (of type _IfcCircle_) and the same trimming points (given by Cartesian points and parameter values) by using different assignments to _Trim1_ and _Trim2_ and _SenseAgreement_.

> NOTE Since the _BasisCurve_ is closed (type _IfcCircle_), the exception of the informal proposition IP3 applies, i.e. the sense flag is not required to be consistent with the parameter values of _Trim1_ and _Trim1_, so the rule (sense = parameter 1 < parameter 2) may not be fulfilled.

{ .extDef}

> * geometric position
> * both of the above

At least one of these shall be specified at each end of the curve. The _SenseAgreement_ makes it possible to unambiguously define any segment of a closed curve such as a circle. The combinations of sense and ordered end points make it possible to define four distinct directed segments connecting two different points on a circle or other closed curve. For this purpose cyclic properties of the parameter range are assumed; for example, 370 degrees is equivalent to 10 degrees.

>
> * if _SenseAgreement_ is TRUE: _s = t - t~1~_
> * if _SenseAgreement_ is FALSE: _s = t~2~ - t_

In the above equations t~1~ is the value given by _Trim1_ or the parameter value corresponding to point 1 and t~2~ is the value given by _Trim2_ or the parameter value corresponding to point 2. The resultant _IfcTrimmedCurve_ has a parameter ranging from 0 at the first trimming point to |t~2~ - t~1~| at the second trimming point.

**Informal Propositions**

1. Where both the parameter value and the Cartesian point exist for _Trim1_ and _Trim2_ they shall be consistent. (i.e., the _BasisCurve_ evaluated at the parameter value shall coincide with the specified point).
2. When a Cartesian point is specified by _Trim1_ or by _Trim2_ it shall lie on the _BasisCurve_.
3. Except the case of a closed _BasisCurve_ where both parameter 1 and parameter 2 exist, they shall be consistent with the sense flag, i.e., (sense = parameter 1 < parameter 2). Or, for every open curve where both parameter 1 and parameter 2 exist, they shall be consistent with the _SenseAgreement_, i.e., _SenseAgreement_ = (parameter 1 < parameter 2).
4. If both parameter 1 and parameter 2 exist, then parameter 1 <> parameter 2. For a closed base curve, e.g. _IfcCircle_ or _IfcEllipse_, this also applies to the cyclic properties, as 360' is equal to 0', parameter 1 = 360' and parameter 2 = 0' are treated as being equal and therefore violating this proposition.
5. When a parameter value is specified by _Trim1_ or _Trim2_ it shall lie within the parametric range of the _BasisCurve_.

### Trim2

IfcGeometryResource
===================

The schema _IfcGeometryResource_ defines the resources used for geometric representations. The primary application of this resource is for representation of the shape or geometric form of an element. The geometric representation items defined here are also used to describe geometric models within the schema _IfcGeometricModelResource_.

The following is within the scope of the geometry resource:

* definition of points directly by their coordinate values and by parameter values on curves and surfaces
* definition of directions, vectors, and axis placements
* definition of transformation operators, both uniform and non-uniform
* definition of parametric curves
* definition of conic curves
* definition of curves defined on a parametric surface
* definition of offset curves
* definition of elementary surfaces
* definition of swept surfaces
* definition of parametric spline curves and surfaces
* definition of mapped items mapping source representations using transformation operators

> NOTE  Many definitions of this schema are adapted from definitions defined within [ISO 10303-42](../content/bibliography.htm#iso-10303-42). The _IfcGeometryResource_ refers to clause 4, "Geometry" of the standard. The definitions of geometric and topological representation, when quoted from [ISO 10303-42](../content/bibliography.htm#iso-10303-42), are explicitly excluded from the copyright of this specification.



> NOTE  Definition according to ISO 10303-42
> **Placement coordinate system**
> A rectangular Cartesian coordinate system associated with the placement of a geometric entity in space, used to describe the interpretation of the attributes and to associate a unique parameterization with curve and surface entities."

> NOTE  Definition according to ISO 10303-42
> **Space Dimensionality**
> All geometry shall be defined in a right-handed rectangular Cartesian coordinate system with the same units on each axis. A common scheme has been used for the definition of both two-dimensional and three-dimensional geometry. Points and directions exists in both a two-dimensional and a three-dimensional form, these forms are distinguished solely by the presence, or absence, of a third coordinate value. Complex geometric entities are all defined using points and directions from which their space dimensionality can be deduced.

> NOTE  Definition according to ISO 10303-42
> **Parameterization of analytic curves and surfaces**
> Each curve on surface specified here has a defined parameterization. In some instances the definitions are in parametric terms. In others, the conic curves and elementary surfaces, the definitions are in geometric terms. In this latter case a placement coordinate system is used to define the parameterization. The geometric definitions contain some, but not all, of the data required for this. The relevant data to define this placement coordinate system is contained in the axis2 placement associated with the individual curve and surface entities.

> NOTE  Definition according to ISO 10303-42
> **Curves**
> The curve entities include lines, some elementary conics, and some referentially or procedurally defined curves. All the curves have a well defined parameterization which makes it possible to trim a curve or identify points on the curve by parameter value. For the conic curves a method of representation is used which separates their geometric form from their orientation and position in space. In each case, the position and orientation information is conveyed by an axis2 placement. A composite curve entity, which includes the facility to communicate continuity information at the curve-to-curve transition points, is provided for the construction of more complex curves. The offset curve type is a curve defined with reference to other geometry. Separate offset curves entities exist for 2D and 3D applications.

> NOTE  Definition according to ISO 10303-42
> **Surfaces**
> The simple surfaces are the planar surface, a surface of revolution and a surface of linear extrusion. As with curves, all surfaces have an associated standard parameterization. In many cases the surfaces, as defined, are unbounded; it is assumed that they will be bounded either explicitly or implicitly. Explicit bounding is achieved with the bounded surface; implicit bounding requires the association of additional topological information to define a face.

The _IfcArcIndex_ describes a single circular arc segment within a poly curve by providing a list on indices. The first index is the start point of the circular arc, the second index is a point on arc, the third index is the end point of the circular arc. The three points shall not be co-linear.

1. The second index, resolving to a point on arc, shall resolve into a Cartesian point that has approximately the same distance to the start point and the end point of the circular arc. This is due to avoid numeric instability, if the point on arc is too close to either the start or the end point.

### DISCONTINUOUS
The segments do not join. This is permitted only at the boundary of the curve or
surface to indicate that it is not closed.

### CONTINUOUS
The segments join but no condition on their tangents is implied.

### CONTSAMEGRADIENT
The segments join and their tangent vectors or tangent planes are parallel and
have the same direction at the joint: equality of derivatives is not required.

### CONTSAMEGRADIENTSAMECURVATURE
For a curve, the segments join, their tangent vectors are parallel and in the same direction and their curvatures are equal at the joint: equality of derivatives is not required. For a surface this implies that the principle curvatures are the same and the principle directions are coincident along the
common boundary.

# IfcMaterial

_IfcMaterial_ is a homogeneous or inhomogeneous substance that can be used to form elements (physical products or their components).
<!-- end of short definition -->

_IfcMaterial_ is the basic entity for material designation and definition; this includes identification by name and classification (via reference to an external classification), as well as association of material properties (isotropic or anisotropic) defined by (subtypes of) _IfcMaterialProperties_. An instance of _IfcMaterial_ may be associated to an element or element type using the _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_ relationship. The assignment might either be direct as a single material information, or via

* a material layer set
* a material profile set
* a material constituent set

An _IfcMaterial_ may also have presentation information associated. Such presentation information is provided by _IfcMaterialDefinitionRepresentation_, associating curve styles, hatching definitions or surface colouring/rendering information to a material.

# IfcMaterialDefinition

_IfcMaterialDefinition_ is a general supertype for all material related information items in IFC that have common material related properties that may include association of material with some shape parameters or assignments to identified parts of a component.
<!-- end of short definition -->

There are three ways of assigning materials to a single component or multiple components; they are characterized as:

* by layer - assigning a material to a layer with constant thickness
* by profile - assigning a material to a profile with a constant of varying shape along an extrusion
* by constituents - assigning a material to an identified part of a component shape; the identification is by a keyword rather than by a shape parameter

Each instantiable subtype of _IfcMaterialDefinition_ may have material properties assigned, or have an external classification of its definition.

# IfcMaterialLayer

_IfcMaterialLayer_ is a single and identifiable part of an element which is constructed of a number of layers (one or more). Each _IfcMaterialLayer_ has a constant thickness and is located relative to the referencing _IfcMaterialLayerSet_ along the material layer set base (MlsBase).
<!-- end of short definition -->

Air gaps within a material layer set are represented as an _IfcMaterialLayer_ with the attribute _IsVentilated_ having the value TRUE or UNKNOWN. Such air gaps shall be interpreted as voids (not having a material).

The inner layer "Brick" would have a _Name_ = "Brick", an individual _LayerThickness_, and potentially a _Category_ indicating it as "load bearing", and a _Priority_ that controls how this material layer interacts with other material layers in wall connections.

The _IfcMaterialLayer_ may have a material layer name which may differ from the _IfcMaterial_ name referenced.

## Attributes

### Material
Optional reference to the material from which the layer is constructed. Note that if this value is not given, it does not denote a layer with no material (an air gap), it only means that the material is not specified at that point.

### LayerThickness
The thickness of the material layer. The meaning of "thickness" depends on its usage. In case of building elements elements utilizing _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_, the dimension is measured along the positive _LayerSetDirection_ as specified in _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_.

> NOTE The attribute value can be 0. for material thicknesses very close to zero, such as for a membrane. Material layers with thickess 0. may not be rendered in the geometric representation.

{ .change-ifc2x4}

### IsVentilated
Indication of whether the material layer represents an air layer (or cavity).
* set to TRUE if the material layer is an air gap and provides air exchange from the layer to the outside air.
* set to UNKNOWN if the material layer is an air gap and does not provide air exchange (or when this information about air exchange of the air gap is not available).
* set to FALSE if the material layer is a solid material layer (the default).

### Name
The name by which the material layer is known.

### Description
Definition of the material layer in more descriptive terms than given by attributes Name or Category.

### Category
Category of the material layer, e.g. the role it has in the layer set it belongs to (such as 'load bearing', 'thermal insulation' etc.). The list of keywords might be extended by model view definitions, however the following keywords shall apply in general:
* 'LoadBearing' — for all material layers having a load bearing function.
* 'Insulation' — for all material layers having an insolating function.
* 'Inner finish' — for the material layer being the inner finish.
* 'Outer finish' — for the material layer being the outer finish.

### Priority
The relative priority of the layer, expressed as normalised integer range [0..100]. Controls how layers intersect in connections and corners of building elements: a layer from one element protrudes into (i.e. displaces) a layer from another element in a joint of these elements if the former element's layer has higher priority than the latter. The priority value for a material layer in an element has to be set and maintained by software applications in relation to the material layers in connected elements.

> NOTE The layer priority at a connection may be overridden by the priority attributes of _IfcRelConnectsPathElements_ if that relationship is used to establish a logical connection between two building elements having a layer structure.

### ToMaterialLayerSet
Reference to the _IfcMaterialLayerSet_ in which the material layer is included.

# IfcMaterialLayerSet

The _IfcMaterialLayerSet_ is a designation by which materials of an element constructed of a number of material layers is known and through which the relative positioning of individual layers can be expressed.
<!-- end of short definition -->

The Material Layer Set Base (MlsBase) describes the imaginary axis along which the material layers are positioned.

* In case of assigning the _IfcMaterialLayerSet_ directly to an element or element type, the individual layers are stacked according to their position within the list of _MaterialLayers_ without providing information on how to spatially relate the material layer information to the shape representation of the element or element type.
* In case of assigning the _IfcMaterialLayerSet_ through an _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ to an element, the MlsBase is positioned along the reference axis or reference plane of the element. An offset from the reference axis or plane to MlsBase is supported by _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ which combines layers and an offset. Offsets from element edges are supported by the subtype _IfcMaterialLayerWithOffsets_. The positive _LayerSetDirection_ (MlsDirection) describes the direction by which the individual material layers are stacked. The _IfcMaterialLayer_'s are stacked with no gap. Gaps within a material layer set are expressed as layers by themselves.

> EXAMPLE A cavity brick wall would be modeled as _IfcMaterialLayerSet_ consisting of three _IfcMaterialLayer_'s: brick, air cavity and brick. The air gap is identified by the _IsVentilated_ flag at _IfcMaterialLayer_.

Attribute use definition

As shown in Figure 1, each _IfcMaterialLayerSet_ implicitly defines a material layer set base line (MlsBase), to which the start of the first _IfcMaterialLayer_ is aligned. The total thickness of a layer set is calculated from the individual layer thicknesses, the first layer starting from the MlsBase and following layers being placed on top of the previous (no gaps or overlaps).

# IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage

The _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ determines the usage of _IfcMaterialLayerSet_ in terms of its location and orientation relative to the associated element geometry. The location of material layer set shall be compatible with the building element geometry (that is, material layers shall fit inside the element geometry). The rules to ensure the compatibility depend on the type of the building element.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> EXAMPLE  For a cavity brick wall with shape representation SweptSolid, the _IfcMaterialLayerSet.TotalThickness_ shall be equal to the wall thickness. Also the _OffsetFromReferenceLine_ shall match the exact positions between the two shape representations of _IfcWall_, that is the _IfcShapeRepresentation_'s with _RepresentationIdentifier_="Axis" and _RepresentationIdentifier_="Body".

> NOTE  Model view definitions or implementer agreements may provide more instructions on matching between building element geometry and material layer set usage.

The _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ is always assigned to an individual occurrence object (and only to relevant subtypes of _IfcElement_). The _IfcMaterialLayerSet_, referenced by _ForLayerSet_, can however be shared among several occurrence objects. If the element type is available (in other words, an instance of the relevant subtype of _IfcElementType_ exists), then the _IfcMaterialLayerSet_ can be assigned to the element type. The assignment between a subtype of _IfcElement_ and the _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ is handled by _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_.

{ .use-head}
Attribute use definition

The _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ is primarily intended to be associated with planar building elements having a constant thickness. With further agreements on the interpretation of _LayerSetDirection_, the usage can be extended also to other cases, for example to curved building elements, provided that the material layer thicknesses are constant.

Generally, an element may be layered in any of its primary directions, denoted by its x, y or z axis. The geometry use definitions at each specific type of building element will determine the applicable _LayerSetDirection_.

The following examples illustrate how the _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ attributes (_LayerSetDirection_, _DirectionSense_, _OffsetFromReferenceLine_) can be used in different cases. Normative material use definitions are documented at each element (how these shall be used).

Figure 1 shows an example of the use of _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ aligned to the axis of a wall.

> EXAMPLE For a layered wall with extruded geometric representation (vertical extrusion), the layer set direction will be perpendicular to extrusion direction, and can be derived from the direction of the wall axis. With the_DirectionSense_ (positive in this example) the individual _IfcMaterialLayers_ are assigned consecutively right-to-left or left-to-right. For a curved wall, "direction denoting the wall thickness" can be derived from the direction of the wall axis, and it will remain perpendicular to the wall path. The _DirectionSense_ applies as well.

> NOTE According to the _IfcWall_ material use definition the _LayerSetDirection_ for _IfcWall_ is always AXIS2 (that is, along the y-axis), as shown in this example.

![Mls usage](../../../../figures/ifcmateriallayersetusage_wall-01.png)

Figure 1 — Material layer set usage for wall

Figure 2 shows an example of the use of _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ aligned to a slab.

> EXAMPLE  For a slab with perpendicular extruded geometric representation, the _LayerSetDirection_ will coincide with the extrusion direction (in positive or negative sense). In this example, the material layer set base is the extruded profile and consistent with the _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid.Position_, with the _DirectionSense_ being positive, the individual _IfcMaterialLayers_ are built up from the base towards the positive z direction in this case.

> NOTE  According to the _IfcSlab_ material use definition the _LayerSetDirection_ for _IfcSlab_ is always AXIS3 (that is, along the z-axis).

![Mls usage](../../../../figures/ifcmateriallayersetusage_slab-01.png)

Figure 2 — Material layer set usage for slab

Figure 3 shows an example of the use of _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ aligned to a roof slab with non-perpendicular extrusion.

> EXAMPLE  For a slab with non-perpendicular extruded geometric representation, the guidelines above apply as well<small>. The material layer thickness and the <em>OffsetFromReferenceLine</em> are always measured
perpendicularly, even if the extrusion direction is not perpendicular. Therefore the total material layer thickness is
not equal to the extrusion depth of the geometry.</small>

## Attributes

### ForLayerSet
The _IfcMaterialLayerSet_ set to which the usage is applied.

### LayerSetDirection
Orientation of the material layer set relative to element reference geometry. The meaning of the value of this attribute shall be specified in the geometry use section for each element. For extruded shape representation, direction can be given along the extrusion path (e.g. for slabs) or perpendicular to it (e.g. for walls).

> NOTE The _LayerSetDirection_ for _IfcWall_ shall be AXIS2 (i.e. the y-axis) and for _IfcSlab_ and _IfcPlate_ it shall be AXIS3 (i.e. the z-axis).

> NOTE Whether the material layers of the set being used shall 'grow' into the positive or negative direction of the given axis, shall be defined by _DirectionSense_ attribute.

### DirectionSense
Denotes whether the material layer set is oriented in positive or negative sense along the specified axis (defined by LayerSetDirection). "Positive" means that the consecutive layers (the _IfcMaterialLayer_ instances in the list of _IfcMaterialLayerSet.MaterialLayers_) are placed face-by-face in the direction of the positive axis as established by LayerSetDirection: for AXIS2 it would be in +y, for AXIS3 it would be +z. "Negative" means that the layers are placed face-by-face in the direction of the negative LayerSetDirection. In both cases, starting at the material layer set base line.
> NOTE the material layer set base line (MlsBase) is located by OffsetFromReferenceLine, and may be on the positive or negative side of the element reference line (or plane); positive or negative for MlsBase placement does not depend on the DirectionSense attribute, but on the relevant element axis.

### OffsetFromReferenceLine
Offset of the material layer set base line (MlsBase) from reference geometry (line or plane) of element. The offset can be positive or negative, unless restricted for a particular building element type in its use definition or by implementer agreement. A positive value means, that the MlsBase is placed on the positive side of the reference line or plane, on the axis established by LayerSetDirection (in case of AXIS2 into the direction of +y, or in case of AXIS2 into the direction of +z). A negative value means that the MlsBase is placed on the negative side, as established by LayerSetDirection (in case of AXIS2 into the direction of -y).
> NOTE the positive or negative sign in the offset only affects the MlsBase placement, it does not have any effect on the application of DirectionSense for orientation of the material layers; also DirectionSense does not change the MlsBase placement.

### ReferenceExtent
Extent of the extrusion of the elements body shape representation to which the _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ applies. It is used as the reference value for the upper _OffsetValues[2]_ provided by the _IfcMaterialLayerWithOffsets_ subtype for included material layers.

{ .change-ifc2x4}

# IfcMaterialLayerWithOffsets

_IfcMaterialLayerWithOffsets_ is a specialization of _IfcMaterialLayer_ enabling definition of offset values along edges (within the material layer set usage in parent layer set).
<!-- end of short definition -->

It defines the assignment of two offset values for a material layer in its intended use within a material layer set. Offsets are applied to the edges of layered elements (that is, in directions perpendicular to the layer set direction). Offsets shall not be used in layer set direction, that is, for modelling gaps (or overlaps) between layers; gaps shall be modeled as layers with appropriate material assignment for the void.

> EXAMPLE At the top of a layered wall, with shape representation 'SweptSolid', offset of a given layer can be specified in the direction of the extrusion (positive Z axis), applied at the start or end (extruded from bottom to top), and with a positive (extending above extrusion) or negative (ending below extrusion).
>
> Take a layered wall with the outer material layer for the external isolation extending above extrusion by 100mm, but starting at the same base height. In this case the following values are set: > * _OffsetDirection_ = .AXIS3.
> * _OffsetValues[1]_ = 0.0
> * _OffsetValues[2]_ = 100.0 (default unit assumed to be mm)

> NOTE The 'Body' shape representation of an _IfcWall_ may have multiple _Items_ each being an _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_ corresponding to the _IfcMaterialLayer_ and _IfcMaterialLayerWithOffsets_.

> HISTORY New entity in IFC4.

**Informal Propositions**

1. The _OffsetDirection_ shall not be identical to the _LayerSetDirection_ of the corresponding _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_.

2. The attribute ReferenceExtent shall be asserted at the corresponding _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_.

{ .use-head}
The _OffsetValues_ and _OffsetDirection_ correspond to the definitions _ReferenceExtent_ and _LayerSetDirection_ at the _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_. Figure 1 shows an example of applying the _OffsetValues_ to the material layers of a layered wall.

### OffsetValues
The numerical value of layer offset, in the direction of the axis assigned by the attribute _OffsetDirection_. The _OffsetValues[1]_ identifies the offset from the lower position along the axis direction (normally the start of the layer extrusion), the _OffsetValues[2]_ identifies the offset from the upper position along the axis direction (normally the end of the layer extrusion).

# IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage

_IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_ determines the usage of _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ in terms of its location relative to the associated element geometry. The location of a material profile set shall be compatible with the building element geometry (that is, material profiles shall fit inside the element geometry). The rules to ensure the compatibility depend on the type of the building element. For building elements with shape representations which are based on extruded solids, this is accomplished by referring to the identical profile definition in the shape model as in the material profile set.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> NOTE Model view definitions or implementer agreements may provide more instructions on matching between building element geometry and material profile set usage.

> NOTE The referenced _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ may represent a single material profile, or a composite profile with two or more material profiles.

## Attributes

### ForProfileSet
The _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ set to which the usage is applied.

### CardinalPoint
Index reference to a significant point in the section profile. Describes how the section is aligned relative to the (longitudinal) axis of the member it is associated with. This parametric specification of profile alignment can be provided redundantly to the explicit alignment defined by ForProfileSet.MaterialProfiles[\*].Profile.

### ReferenceExtent
Extent of the extrusion of the elements body shape representation to which the _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_ applies. It is used as the reference value for the upper _OffsetValues[2]_ provided by the _IfcMaterialProfileWithOffsets_ subtype for included material profiles.

> NOTE The attribute _ReferenceExtent_ shall be asserted if an _IfcMaterialProfileWithOffsets_ is included in the _ForProfileSet.MaterialProfiles_ list of material layers.

# IfcMaterialUsageDefinition

_IfcMaterialUsageDefinition_ is a general supertype for all material related information items in IFC that have occurrence specific assignment parameters to assign a set of materials with shape parameters to a reference geometry item of that component.

There are two ways of assigning a set of materials with shape parameters:

* a layer set to a reference curve - assigning a material layer set with material layers having a sequence and thickness parameter to a reference curve of an element - represented by the 'Axis' shape representation of that element
* a profile set to a cardinal point - assigning a material profile set with assigned profile geometry and insertion points to a reference curve by an offset, called "cardinal point" - the reference curve is represented by the 'Axis' shape representation of that element

Each instantiable subtype of _IfcMaterialUsageDefinition_ has to be assigned to a subtype of _IfcElement_ by using the objectified relationship _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_; it is only valid in conjunction with an element occurrence.

IfcMaterialResource
===================

The schema _IfcMaterialResource_ contains the types and entities that are used to define materials (substances, of which products are made of). Materials are defined generically.

> NOTE  The references to the usage of materials is made from the relevant elements through the objectified relationship _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_.

Material definitions are distinguished by how they apply to elements or element types and by their components (layers, profiles, parts).

Material designation can be made for element occurrences to support a limited range of their parametric representation using

1. a structured set of material layers _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ and how the layers relate to the reference axis or plane,
2. a structured set of material profiles _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_ and how the profiles relate to the reference axis.

Material designation can be made for element occurrences or element types without applying a parametric meaning using

1. a set of material layers (with a specified configuration by sequence and thickness of material layers) _IfcMaterialLayerSet_, or
2. a set of material profiles (with a specified configuration by positioning and outline profile of material profiles) _IfcMaterialProfileSet_, or
3. a set of materials (without a specified configuration or structure) _IfcMaterialConstituentSet_, or
4. as fallback by a single material _IfcMaterial_ (including composite materials),

These options are exposed for association with _IfcElement_ or _IfcElementType_ and their subtypes through a select type _IfcMaterialSelect_. The association is realized by the objectified relationship _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_, accessible by the inverse relationship _AssociatedTo_. Some associations to specific material entities may be restricted as not being appropriate within the specialized element or element type definitions.

The following material properties and information sets can be assigned to an _IfcMaterialDefinition_, or only to a single _IfcMaterial_.

* Material properties;
* Material classification and material library reference;
* Material presentation in shape models (e.g. by color, hatching, rendering);
* Relation to the ingredients of a material composite.

> HISTORY  New schema in IFC1.0

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE  Definition of material properties and their assignment to _IfcMaterial_ or other appropriate options in _IfcMaterialSelect_ is now fully captured by _IfcMaterialProperties_ using the general _IfcProperty_ approach. Specific predefined subtypes of _IfcMaterialProperties_ are no longer available.

{ .deprecated}
> DEPRECATION  Material designation by using _IfcMaterialList_ is deprecated and should not be used. The classification of materials should not be done using _IfcMaterialClassificationRelationship_ anymore (entity type deprecated); the _IfcExternalReferenceRelationship_ in _IfcExternalReferenceResource_ schema should be used instead.

# IfcCardinalPointReference

An _IfcCardinalPointReference_ is an index reference to significant points of a section profile. This index is used to describe the spatial relationship between the section of a member and a reference axis of the same member.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> HISTORY  New Type in IFC4.

Indexes 1...9 refer to points at the bounding box of a profile. Indexes 10...19 refer to points defined by geometric centroid (usually centre of gravity) and shear centre, and their combinations with bounding box coordinates. In particular, the following index values are specified in this specification:

1. bottom left
2. bottom centre
3. bottom right
4. mid-depth left
5. mid-depth centre
6. mid-depth right
7. top left
8. top centre
9. top right
10. geometric centroid
11. bottom in line with the geometric centroid
12. left in line with the geometric centroid
13. right in line with the geometric centroid
14. top in line with the geometric centroid
15. shear centre
16. bottom in line with the shear centre
17. left in line with the shear centre
18. right in line with the shear centre
19. top in line with the shear centre
20. Lowest point inside of pipe or channel profile (centre of flat bottom)

Other index values are possible but outside the scope of this specification.

Figure 1 illustrates cardinal point values. Figure 2 illustrates an example extrusion shape with arbitrary profile (_IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef_), aligned "mid-depth right" on the member axis. The line of sight follows the extrusion direction Z which points into the drawing plane of above illustration. Hence, "left" is in the positive X direction of the _IfcProfileDef_. "Top" is in the positive Y direction of the _IfcProfileDef_.

IfcMeasureResource
==================

The _IfcMeasureResource_ schema specifies units and defined measure types that may be assigned to quantities.

> NOTE  The fundamental unit types used in this schema are based on the SI system defined in ISO 1000+A1, 1992, 1998. Units in measurement systems other than SI may be derived using this schema. Many definitions declared in the _IfcMeasureResource_ schema is adapted from [ISO 10303-41](../content/bibliography.htm#iso-10303-41)

> NOTE  In the definitions of the unit exponents the use of superscript font has been omitted. Therefore, m2 means square metre, m3 means cubic meter.

In different types of units there are five basic cases:

* Basic SI-units, which cover a number of fundamental units of mainly physical quantities defined by [ISO-1000](../content/bibliography.htm#iso-1000){ .int-ref} such as meter or millimeter as unit for length measure or square meter as a unit for area measure. The unit may have a scaling prefix (for example: milli, kilo).
* Derived SI-units, which are defined as a derivation of the basic SI-units, for example, Newton (kg m / s2) as a unit of force. Both basic and derived SI-units are in the IFCs represented by IfcSIUnit.
* Conversion based units, which can be derived from SI-units by a scaling factor; e.g. inch which can be defined using SI-unit for length measure, i.e. an inch is 25.4 millimeters.
* Derived units, which can be defined as a derivation or combination of a number of basic units. In a derived unit each of the basic unit "component" has a dimensional exponent in defining the derived unit; e.g. kg / m2, where kilogram (kg) has dimensional exponent 1 and meter (m) has exponent -2.
* Context dependent units, which cannot be defined as conversion based unit using SI-units.

With regard to the usage of the measure defined types (for example, _IfcLengthMeasure_, _IfcTimeMeasure_) as attribute datatypes in this specification, there are three basic cases:

First, the datatype of an attribute of an entity type is a measure defined type as such without possibility on an instance level to define the unit of the measure value:

```
ENTITY IfcBoundingBox
SUBTYPE OF(IfcGeometricRepresentationItem);
Corner : IfcCartesianPoint;
XDim : IfcPositiveLengthMeasure;
YDim : IfcPositiveLengthMeasure;
ZDim : IfcPositiveLengthMeasure;
END_ENTITY;
```

In this case, it is the global unit assignment for the corresponding unit for the measure type that defines the unit for all the usages of this defined measure type (except for cases 2 and 3 below).

Second, the datatype of an attribute is IfcMeasureWithUnit, which allows for definition of unit per instance of that entity type, independent and possibly overriding the global unit assignment:

```
ENTITY IfcConversionBasedUnit
 SUPERTYPE OF (ONEOF
  (IfcConversionBasedUnitWithOffset))
 SUBTYPE OF (IfcNamedUnit);
  Name : IfcLabel;
  ConversionFactor : IfcMeasureWithUnit;
END_ENTITY;
```

In this case the relevant measure defined type (from the IfcMeasureWithUnit.ValueComponent : IfcValue select list) is not exactly defined by the schema, but implied by the context.

Third, the entity type has a separate "unit" attribute which allows for defining the unit for another attribute of the entity type for representing the actual value:

```
ENTITY IfcPropertySingleValue
SUBTYPE OF (IfcSimpleProperty);
NominalValue : IfcValue;
Unit : OPTIONAL IfcUnit;
END_ENTITY;
```

Although in the cases 2 and 3 different units could be used for different instances of the same entity type or for the same measure type in attributes of different entity types, it is recommended not to mix different units for same measure defined types, if it can be avoided. Below some examples of each of the above basic cases are given.

> NOTE  In the example instantiations in the form of IFC data exchange files, mainly the measure and unit -relevant attributes are given the values; the other attributes are given no values (in the form of $-sign) independent of whether they should actually have values because of being nonoptional attributes.

# IfcComplexNumber

_IfcComplexNumber_ is a representation of a complex number expressed as an array with two elements. The first element (index 1) denotes the real component which is the numerical component of a complex number whose square roots can be calculated explicitly. The second element (index 2) denotes the imaginary component which is the numerical component of a complex number whose square roots cannot be determined other than through the provision of the square of the imaginary number j where j\^2 = -1. Note that the imaginary component may be referred to as i in certain references.

# IfcCompoundPlaneAngleMeasure

_IfcCompoundPlaneAngleMeasure_ is a compound measure of plane angle in degrees, minutes, seconds, and optionally millionth-seconds of arc.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> NOTE _IfcCompoundPlaneAngleMeasure_ is used where angles need to be described to an accuracy as fine as one millionth of a degree and expressed as parts of an arc. It may be used for angular measurement by surveyors or for other angular measurements where precision is required. Another usage is exact or approximate global positioning against a geographic coordinate systems using longitude and latitude.

> NOTE While the unit of measurement of the type _IfcPlaneAngleMeasure_ depends on unit assignment (radian or degree or other derived units; globally at the _IfcProject_ or locally at an _IfcMeasureWithUnit_), the units of _IfcCompoundPlaneAngleMeasure_ are always degrees, minutes, seconds, and millionth-seconds irrespective of unit assignments.

> HISTORY New type in IFC1.5.1.

Type: LIST [3:4] OF INTEGER

{ .use-head}
Value restrictions

* The first integer measure is the number of degrees and is generally not range-restricted. However, when _IfcCompoundPlaneAngleMeasure_ is used to express geographic coordinates, only latitudes of [-90, 90] and longitudes of [-180, 180] are used in practice.
* The second integer measure is the number of minutes and shall be in the range (-60, 60).
* The third integer measure is the number of seconds and shall be in the range (-60, 60).
* The optional fourth integer measure is the number of millionth-seconds and shall be in the range (-1 000 000, 1 000 000).

{ .use-head}
Signedness

All measure components have the same sign (positive or negative). It is therefore trivial to convert between floating point representation (decimal degrees) and compound representation regardless whether the angle is greater or smaller than zero. Example:

>
> ```
>
LOCAL
>  a : IfcPlaneAngleMeasure := -50.975864; (\* decimal degrees, -50° 58' 33" 110400 \*)
>  b : IfcPlaneAngleMeasure;
>  c : IfcCompoundPlaneAngleMeasure;
>  s : IfcText;
> END_LOCAL;
>
> (\* convert from float to compound \*)
>  c[1] :=  a;                      -- -50
>  c[2] :=  (a - c[1]) \* 60;               -- -58
>  c[3] := ((a - c[1]) \* 60 - c[2]) \* 60;         -- -33
>  c[4] := (((a - c[1]) \* 60 - c[2]) \* 60 - c[3]) \* 1.e6; -- -110400
>
> (\* convert from compound to float \*)
>  b := c[1] + c[2]/60. + c[3]/3600. + c[4]/3600.e6;    -- -50.975864
>
> ```


{ .use-head}
Use in string representations

When a compound plane angle measure is formatted for display or printout, the signs of the fractional components will usually be discarded because, to a human reader, the sign of the first component alone already indicates the sense of the angle:

>
> ```
>
(\* convert from compound to human-readable string \*)
>  s := FORMAT(c[1], '+##')   + "000000B0"
>   + FORMAT(ABS(c[2]), '##') + ''''
>   + FORMAT(ABS(c[3]), '##') + '"'
>   + FORMAT(ABS(c[4]), '##'); -- -50° 58' 33" 110400

> ```


Another often encountered display format of latitudes and longitudes is to omit the signs and print N, S, E, W indicators instead, for example,
```
50°58'33"S
```
. When stored as _IfcCompoundPlaneAngleMeasure_ however, a compound plane angle measure is always signed, with same sign of all components.

## Formal Propositions

### MinutesInRange
The second measure (minutes) shall be between -60 exclusive and 60 exclusive.

### SecondsInRange
The third measure (seconds) shall be between -60 exclusive and 60 exclusive.

### MicrosecondsInRange
The forth measure (millionth-seconds), if asserted, shall be between -1e6 exclusive and 1e6 exclusive.

### ConsistentSign
All non-zero measure components shall have the same sign (positive or negative).

# IfcFillAreaStyleHatching

The _IfcFillAreaStyleHatching_ is used to define simple, vector-based hatching patterns, based on styled straight lines. The curve font, color and thickness is given by the _HatchLineAppearance_, the angle by the _HatchLineAngle_ and the distance to the next hatch line by _StartOfNextHatchLine_, being either an offset distance or a vector.
<!-- end of short definition -->

{ .extDef}
> NOTE Definition according to ISO 10303-46:
> The fill area style hatching defines a styled pattern of curves for hatching an annotation fill area or a surface.

> NOTE If the hatch pattern involves two (potentially crossing) rows of hatch lines, then two instances of _IfcFillAreaStyleHatching_ should be assigned to the _IfcFillAreaStyle_. Both share the same (virtual) point of origin of the hatching that is used by the reference hatch line (or the _PointOfReferenceHatchLine_ if there is an offset).

For better control of the hatching appearance, when using hatch lines with other fonts then continuous, the _PatternStart_ allows to offset the start of the curve font pattern along the reference hatch line (if not given, the _PatternStart_ is at zero distance from the virtual point of origin). If the reference hatch line does not go through the origin (of the virtual hatching coordinate system), it can be offset by using the _PatternStart_ .

> NOTE The coordinates of the _PatternStart_ are given relative to the origin of the object coordinate of _IfcAnnotationFillArea_, or if present, the _FillAreaTarget_ attribute of _IfcAnnotationFillArea_. The measure values are given in global drawing length units, representing a model hatching, and can be translated into drawing units by the _TargetScale_ for a scale depended _IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext_, if provided.

{ .deprecated}

![hatch example 1](../../../../figures/ifcfillareastylehatching_fig1.gif)

Figure 1 — Example 1

Figure 1 shows simple hatching given by using a curve font "continuous" at <em>HatchLineAppearance</em>.

The distance of hatch lines is given by a positive length measure. The angle (here 45' if measures in degree) is provided by <em>HatchLineAngle</em>.

The <em>PatternStart</em> is set to NIL ($) in this example.

![hatch example 2](../../../../figures/ifcfillareastylehatching_fig2.gif)

Figure 2 — Example 2

Figure 2 shows hatching from example 1 with using a different curve font at <em>HatchLineAppearance</em>.

The distance of hatch lines is given by a positive length measure, therefore the font pattern start is at a point at the next hatch line given by a vector being perpendicular to the point of origin at the reference hatch line.

The <em>PatternStart</em> is set to NIL ($) in this example.

![hatch example 3](../../../../figures/ifcfillareastylehatching_fig3.gif)

Figure 3 — Example 3

Figure 3 uses hatching from example 2 with a vector to determine the pattern start of the next hatch lines.

The pattern start is the beginning of the first visual curve font pattern segment at <em>IfcCurveStyleFont.PatternList</em>.

The <em>PatternStart</em> is set to NIL ($) in this example.

![hatch example 4](../../../../figures/ifcfillareastylehatching_fig4.gif)

Figure 4 — Example 4

Figure 4 uses hatching from example 3 where the pattern start is offset from the point of origin at the reference hatch line. That is, the first visible curve font pattern segment now does not start at the point of origin at the reference hatch line.

![fig 6](../../../../figures/ifcfillareastylehatching_fig6.gif)

Figure 6 — Example 5

This example shows use of <em>IfcFillAreaStyleHatching</em> attributes for two <em>IfcFillAreaStyleHatching</em>'s within one <em>IfcFillAreaStyle</em>.

Note that the <em>PatternStart</em> now displaces both the reference hatch line from the point of origin and the start of the curve pattern. This can be used in cases when more than one <em>IfcFillAreaStyleHatching</em> is used in an <em>IfcFillAreaStyle</em> in order to place rows of hatch lines with an offset from each other.

The following definitions from ISO/IEC 19775-1 X3D Architecture and base components ([X3D Specification](http://www.web3d.org/x3d/specifications/)) apply:

* Greyscale pixels without alpha or simple transparency are treated as intensity textures.
* Greyscale pixels with alpha or simple transparency are treated as intensity plus alpha textures.
* RGB pixels without alpha channel or simple transparency are treated as full RGB textures.
* RGB pixels with alpha channel or simple transparency are treated as full RGB plus alpha textures.
* If the image specifies colours as indexed-colour (that is, palettes or colourmaps), the following semantics should be used (note that `greyscale' refers to a palette entry with equal red, green, and blue values):
  1. If all the colours in the palette are greyscale and there is no transparency chunk, it is treated as an intensity texture.
  2. If all the colours in the palette are greyscale and there is a transparency chunk, it is treated as an intensity plus opacity texture.
  3. If any colour in the palette is not grey and there is no transparency chunk, it is treated as a full RGB texture.
  4. If any colour in the palette is not grey and there is a transparency chunk, it is treated as a full RGB plus alpha texture.
* Texture nodes that require support for JPEG files shall interpret JPEG files as follows:
  1. Greyscale files (number of components equals 1) are treated as intensity textures.
  2. YCbCr files are treated as full RGB textures.
  3. No other JPEG file types are required. It is recommended that other JPEG files are treated as a full RGB textures.
* Texture nodes that recommend support for GIF files shall follow the applicable semantics described above for the PNG format.

# IfcPixelTexture

An _IfcPixelTexture_ provides a 2D image-based texture map as an explicit array of pixel values (list of _Pixel_ binary attributes). In contrary to the _IfcImageTexture_ the _IfcPixelTexture_ holds a 2 dimensional list of pixel color (and opacity) directly, instead of referencing to an URL.
<!-- end of short definition -->

The following definitions from ISO/IEC 19775-1 X3D Architecture and base components ([X3D Specification](http://www.web3d.org/x3d/specifications/)) apply:

* The PixelTexture node defines a 2D image-based texture map as an explicit array of pixel values (image field) and parameters controlling tiling repetition of the texture onto geometry.
* Texture maps are defined in a 2D coordinate system (s, t) that ranges from 0.0 to 1.0 in both directions. The bottom edge of the pixel image corresponds to the S-axis of the texture map, and left edge of the pixel image corresponds to the T-axis of the texture map. The lower-left pixel of the pixel image corresponds to s=0.0, t=0.0, and the top-right pixel of the image corresponds to s = 1.0, t = 1.0.
* The Image field specifies a single uncompressed 2-dimensional pixel image. Image fields contain three integers representing the width, height and number of components in the image, followed by width×height hexadecimal values representing the pixels in the image. Pixel values are limited to 256 levels of intensity (that is, 0x00-0xFF hexadecimal).
  1. A one-component image specifies one-byte hexadecimal value representing the intensity of the image. For example, 0xFF is full intensity in hexadecimal (255 in decimal), 0x00 is no intensity (0 in decimal).
  2. A two-component image specifies the intensity in the first (high) byte and the alpha opacity in the second (low) byte.
  3. Pixels in a three-component image specify the red component in the first (high) byte, followed by the green and blue components (for example, 0xFF0000 is red, 0x00FF00 is green, 0x0000FF is blue).
  4. Four-component images specify the alpha opacity byte after red/green/blue (e.g., 0x0000FF80 is semi-transparent blue). A value of 00 is completely transparent, FF is completely opaque, 80 is semi-transparent.
* <font size="-1">Note that alpha equals (1.0 -transparency), if alpha and transparency each range from 0.0 to 1.0.</font>

> EXAMPLE A green glass transmits only green light, so its transmission factor is 0.0 for red, between 0.0 and 1.0 for green and 0.0 for blue. A green surface reflects only green light, so the reflectance factor is 0.0 for red, between 0.0 and 1.0 for green and 0.0 for blue.

## Attributes

### DiffuseTransmissionColour
The degree of diffusion of the transmitted light. In the case of completely transparent materials there is no diffusion. The greater the diffusing power, the smaller the direct component of the transmitted light, up to the point where only diffuse light is produced. A value of 1 means totally diffuse for that colour part of the light.
> NOTE The factor can be measured physically and has three ratios for the red, green and blue part of the light.

### DiffuseReflectionColour
The degree of diffusion of the reflected light. In the case of specular surfaces there is no diffusion. The greater the diffusing power of the reflecting surface, the smaller the specular component of the reflected light, up to the point where only diffuse light is produced. A value of 1 means totally diffuse for that colour part of the light.
> NOTE The factor can be measured physically and has three ratios for the red, green and blue part of the light.

### TransmissionColour
Describes how the light falling on a body is totally or partially transmitted.

> The factor can be measured physically and has three ratios for the red, green and blue part of the light.

### ReflectanceColour
A coefficient that determines the extent that the light falling onto a surface is fully or partially reflected.

# IfcSurfaceStyleRefraction

_IfcSurfaceStyleRefraction_ extends the surface style lighting, or the surface style rendering definition for properties for calculation of physically exact illuminance by adding seldom used properties. Currently this includes the refraction index (by which the light ray refracts when passing through a prism) and the dispersion factor (or Abbe constant) which takes into account the wavelength dependency of the refraction.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> NOTE If such refraction properties are used, the _IfcSurfaceStyle_ should include within its set of _Styles_ (depending on whether rendering or lighting is used) an instance of _IfcSurfaceStyleLighting_ and _IfcSurfaceStyleRefraction_, or an instance of _IfcSurfaceStyleRendering_ and _IfcSurfaceStyleRefraction_.

## Attributes

### RefractionIndex
The index of refraction for all wave lengths of light. The refraction index is the ratio between the speed of light in a vacuum and the speed of light in the medium. E.g. glass has a refraction index of 1.5, whereas water has an index of 1.33

### DispersionFactor
The Abbe constant given as a fixed ratio between the refractive indices of the material at different wavelengths. A low Abbe number means a high dispersive power. In general this translates to a greater angular spread of the emergent spectrum.

# IfcSurfaceStyleRendering

IfcSurfaceStyleRendering holds the properties for visualization related to a particular surface style. Three lighting models are supported:
<!-- end of short definition -->

- Phong lighting model
- Physically based lighting model
- Flat lighting model that ignores light sources

The material parameters are specified as scalars or RGB colors. Every material parameter can be adjusted using a texture. This allows to vary this parameter across the surface. The information sampled from the texture is always multiplied by the simple scalar/color fields.

> NOTE Refer to the ISO/IEC 19775-1 X3D [17 Lighting component](https://www.web3d.org/specifications/X3Dv4Draft/ISO-IEC19775-1v4-CD/Part01/components/lighting.html) section for a detailed description of the lighting model equations.

> HISTORY New entity in IFC2x.

## Attributes

### DiffuseColour
In a PHONG ReflectanceMethod, the DiffuseColour correlates to the diffuseColor attribute in the X3D Phong lighting model. The diffuse colour reflects all X3D light sources depending on the angle of the surface with respect to the light source. The more directly the surface faces the light, the more diffuse light reflects. In a PHYSICAL ReflectanceMethod, a physical based lighting model is assumed, and so the DiffuseColour correlates to the baseColor attribute used in the X3D physical lighting model. In a FLAT ReflectanceMethod, the DiffuseColour correlates to the emissiveColor attribute used in the X3D unlit lighting model.

> IFC4.3.0.0 CHANGE Attribute has been repurposed to fit the X3D reflectance methods.

### TransmissionColour
The transmissive part of the reflectance equation can be given as either a colour or a scalar factor. It only applies to materials which Transparency field is greater than zero.
The transmissive colour field specifies the colour that passes through a transparent material (like the colour that shines through a glass).
The transmissive factor defines the transmissive part, the transmissive colour is then defined by surface colour \* transmissive factor.

> IFC4.3.0.0 DEPRECATION This attribute is deprecated and shall no longer be used.

### DiffuseTransmissionColour
The diffuse transmission part of the reflectance equation can be given as either a colour or a scalar factor. It only applies to materials whose Transparency field is greater than zero.
The diffuse transmission colour specifies how much diffuse light is reflected at the opposite side of the material surface.
The diffuse transmission factor field specifies how much diffuse light from light sources this surface shall reflect on the opposite side of the material surface. The diffuse transmissive colour is then defined by surface colour \* diffuse transmissive factor.

> IFC4.3.0.0 DEPRECATION This attribute is deprecated and shall no longer be used.

### ReflectionColour
The reflection (or mirror) part of the reflectance equation can be given as either a colour or a scalar factor. Applies to "glass" and "mirror" reflection models.
The reflection colour specifies the contribution made by light from the mirror direction, i.e. light being reflected from the surface.
The reflection factor specifies the amount of contribution made by light from the mirror direction. The reflection colour is then defined by surface colour \* reflection factor.

> IFC4.3.0.0 DEPRECATION This attribute is deprecated and shall no longer be used.

### SpecularColour
In a PHONG ReflectanceMethod, the SpecularColour correlates to the specularColor attribute in the X3D Phong lighting model. The specular colour determine the colour of the specular highlights ( e.g., the shiny spots on an apple). In a PHYSICAL ReflectanceMethod, a physical based lighting model is assumed, and so the SpecularColour is specified as a IfcNormalisedRatioMeasure, which correlates to the metallic attribute used in the X3D physical lighting model. In a FLAT ReflectanceMethod, the SpecularColour has no effect.

> IFC4.3.0.0 CHANGE Attribute has been repurposed to fit the X3D reflectance methods.

### SpecularHighlight
In a PHONG ReflectanceMethod, the SpecularHighlight is specified as a IfcSpecularRoughness and correlates to the inverse of the shininess attribute in the X3D Phong lighting model. The SpecularHighlight determines the nature of the specular highlights ( e.g., the shiny spots on an apple). Lower shininess values produce soft glows, while higher values result in sharper, smaller highlights. In a PHYSICAL ReflectanceMethod, a physical based lighting model is assumed, and so the SpecularHighlight is specified as a IfcSpecularRoughness, which correlates to the roughness attribute used in the X3D physical lighting model. In a FLAT ReflectanceMethod, the SpecularHighlight has no effect.

> IFC4.3.0.0 CHANGE Attribute has been repurposed to fit the X3D reflectance methods.

### ReflectanceMethod
Identifies the predefined types of reflectance method from which the method required may be set. PHONG correlates to the X3D Phong lighting model. PHYSICAL correlates to the X3D Physical lighting model. FLAT correlates to the X3D Unlit lighting model. The exact behaviour of other reflectance methods may be determined by view definitions or implementer agreements.

# IfcSurfaceTexture

An _IfcSurfaceTexture_ provides a 2-dimensional image-based texture map. It can either be given by referencing an external image file through an URL reference (_IfcImageTexture_), including the image file as a blob (long binary) into the data set (_IfcBlobTexture_), or by explicitly including an array of pixels (_IfcPixelTexture_).
<!-- end of short definition -->

The following definitions from ISO/IEC 19775-1 X3D Architecture and base components ([X3D Specification](http://www.web3d.org/x3d/specifications/)) apply:

 * Texture: An image used in a texture map to create visual appearance effects when applied to geometry.
 * Texture map: A texture plus the general parameters necessary for mapping the texture to geometry.
 * Textures are defined by 2D images that contain an array of colour values describing the texture. The texture values are interpreted differently depending on the number of components in the texture and the specifics of the image format. In general, texture may be described using one of the following forms:
  1. Intensity textures (one-component)
  2. Intensity plus alpha opacity textures (two-component)
  3. Full RGB textures (three-component)
  4. Full RGB plus alpha opacity textures (four-component)

> NOTE Image formats specify an alpha opacity, not transparency (where alpha = 1 - transparency).

### Texture coordinate systems

Figure 1 illustrates the texture coordinate system.

![texture coordinates](../../../../figures/ifcsurfacetexture_fig-1.png "Figure 1 — Surface texture coordinates")

The following definitions from ISO/IEC 19775-1 X3D Architecture and base components ([X3D Specification](http://www.web3d.org/x3d/specifications/)) on texture coordinates apply:

 * Texture maps are defined in a 2D coordinate system (s, t) that ranges from [0.0, 1.0] in both directions. The bottom edge of the image corresponds to the S-axis of the texture map, and left edge of the image corresponds to the T-axis of the texture map. The lower-left pixel of the image corresponds to s=0, t=0, and the top-right pixel of the image corresponds to s=1, t=1. Texture maps may be viewed as two dimensional colour functions that, given an <em>(s, t)</em> coordinate, return a colour value <em>colour(s, t)</em>.
 * The _RepeatS_ and _RepeatT_ Boolean flags control whether the texture map is repeated outside the [0.0, 1.0] texture coordinate range, when applied to a geometric surface, or clamped to lie within the [0.0, 1.0] range. The _TextureTransform_ applies a 2D non-uniform transformation to the texture before it is applied to a geometric surface.
 * These parameters support changes to the size, orientation, and position of textures on shapes. Note that these operations appear reversed when viewed on the surface of geometry. For example, a <em>scale</em> value of (2 2) will scale the texture coordinates and have the net effect of shrinking the texture size by a factor of 2 (texture coordinates are twice as large and thus cause the texture to repeat). A translation of (0.5 0.0) translates the texture coordinates +.5 units along the S-axis and has the net effect of translating the texture −0.5 along the S-axis on the geometry's surface. A rotation of π/2 of the texture coordinates results in a −π/2 rotation of the texture on the geometry.
 * The <em>center</em> field specifies a translation offset in texture coordinate space about which the <em>rotation</em> and <em>scale</em> fields are applied. The <em>scale</em> field specifies a scaling factor in S and T of the texture coordinates about the <em>center</em> point. <em>scale</em> values shall be in the range (−∞,∞). The <em>rotation</em> field specifies a rotation in radians of the texture coordinates about the <em>center</em> point after the scale has been applied. A positive rotation value makes the texture coordinates rotate counterclockwise about the centre, thereby rotating the appearance of the texture itself clockwise. The <em>translation</em> field specifies a translation of the texture coordinates.

The following conventions apply:

 * center = <em>TextureTransform.LocalOrigin</em>;
 * rotation = <em>TextureTransform.Axis1</em>
 * scale S = <em>TextureTransform.Scale</em>
 * scale T = <em>TextureTransform.Scale2</em>

The mapping of the texture onto the surface or the solid is determined with the following priority:

 1. If the geometry is of a special IFC type which defines a texture mapping, such as an IfcSphere, IfcBlock, or IfcExtrudedAreaSolid, then that definition is the default texture mapping.
 2. If IfcTextureCoordinate texture coordinates are assigned to a surface texture, these texture coordinates are used.
 3. If the geometry has no texture mapping definition and no texture coordinates, the texture s coordinate comes from local vertex X coordinate, and t coordinate comes from local vertex Y coordinate. Along each axis, the s and t texture coordinate goes from 0 to 1, as the geometry goes from bounding box minimum to maximum.

### Texture modes

A texture may belong to a mode, which determines how the texture affects the reflectance method in IfcSurfaceStyleRendering as described in Table 1. Only a single texture may be supplied per texture Mode type (DIFFUSE, SPECULAR, etc).

Mode | PHONG | PHYSICAL | FLAT
--- | --- | --- | ---

## Attributes

### RepeatS
The _RepeatS_ field specifies how the texture wraps in the S direction. If _RepeatS_ is TRUE (the default), the texture map is repeated outside the [0.0, 1.0] texture coordinate range in the S direction so that it fills the shape. If _RepeatS_ is FALSE, the texture coordinates are clamped in the S direction to lie within the [0.0, 1.0] range.

### RepeatT
The _RepeatT_ field specifies how the texture wraps in the T direction. If _RepeatT_ is TRUE (the default), the texture map is repeated outside the [0.0, 1.0] texture coordinate range in the T direction so that it fills the shape. If _RepeatT_ is FALSE, the texture coordinates are clamped in the T direction to lie within the [0.0, 1.0] range.

{ .extDef}
<!-- end of short definition -->

> Definition according to W3C for Cascading Style Sheets:
> Setting font properties will be among the most common uses of style sheets. Unfortunately, there exists no well-defined and universally accepted taxonomy for classifying fonts, and terms that apply to one font family may not be appropriate for others. For example, 'italic' is commonly used to label slanted text, but slanted text may also be labeled as being _Oblique_, _Slanted_, _Incline_, _Cursive_ or _Kursiv_. Therefore it is not a simple problem to map typical font selection properties to a specific font.

{ .extDef}
> **Font matching**
> Because there is no accepted, universal taxonomy of font properties, matching of properties to font faces must be done carefully. The properties are matched in a well-defined order to ensure that the results of this matching process are as consistent as possible across user agents (assuming that the same library of font faces is presented to each of them).

1. The user agent makes (or accesses) a database of relevant CSS1 properties of all the fonts of which the UA is aware. The UA may be aware of a font because it has been installed locally or it has been previously downloaded over the web. If there are two fonts with exactly the same properties, one of them is ignored.
2. At a given element and for each character in that element, the UA assembles the font-properties applicable to that element. Using the complete set of properties, the UA uses the 'font-family' property to choose a tentative font family. The remaining properties are tested against the family according to the matching criteria described with each property. If there are matches for all the remaining properties, then that is the matching font face for the given element.
3. If there is no matching font face within the 'font-family' being processed by step 2, and if there is a next alternative 'font-family' in the font set, then repeat step 2 with the next alternative 'font-family'.
4. If there is a matching font face, but it doesn't contain a glyph for the current character, and if there is a next alternative 'font-family' in the font sets, then repeat step 2 with the next alternative 'font-family'.
5. If there is no font within the family selected in 2, then use a UA-dependent default 'font-family' and repeat step 2, using the best match that can be obtained within the default font.

(The above algorithm can be optimized to avoid having to revisit the CSS1 properties for each character.)

The per-property matching rules from (2) above are as follows:

1. 'font-style' is tried first. 'italic' will be satisfied if there is either a face in the UA's font database labeled with the CSS keyword 'italic' (preferred) or 'oblique'. Otherwise the values must be matched exactly or font-style will fail.
2. 'font-variant' is tried next. 'normal' matches a font not labeled as 'small-caps'; 'small-caps' matches (1) a font labeled as 'small-caps', (2) a font in which the small caps are synthesized, or (3) a font where all lowercase letters are replaced by upper case letters. A small-caps font may be synthesized by electronically scaling uppercase letters from a normal font.
3. 'font-weight' is matched next, it will never fail. (See 'font-weight' below.)
4. 'font-size' must be matched within a UA-dependent margin of tolerance. (Typically, sizes for scalable fonts are rounded to the nearest whole pixel, while the tolerance for bitmapped fonts could be as large as 20%.) Further computations, are based on the 'font-size' value that is used, not the one that is specified.

The inherited _Name_ attribute is used to define the font name, particularly in cases, where no (list of) font families are provided.

<!-- end of short definition -->

{ .extDef}
> NOTE Definition according to Cascading Style Sheets, level 1
> The values '100' to '900' form an ordered sequence, where each number indicates a weight that is at least as dark as its predecessor. The keyword 'normal' is synonymous with '400', and 'bold' is synonymous with '700'. Keywords other than 'normal' and 'bold' have been shown to be often confused with font names and a numerical scale was therefore chosen for the 9-value list.

{ .extDef}
> Fonts (the font data) typically have one or more properties whose values are names that are descriptive of the "weight" of a font. There is no accepted, universal meaning to these weight names. Their primary role is to distinguish faces of differing darkness within a single font family. Usage across font families is quite variant; for example a font that you might think of as being bold might be described as being _Regular, Roman, Book, Medium, Semi-_ or _DemiBold, Bold,_ or _Black,_ depending on how black the "normal" face of the font is within the design. Because there is no standard usage of names, the weight property values in CSS1 are given on a numerical scale in which the value '400' (or 'normal') corresponds to the "normal" text face for that family. The weight name associated with that face will typically be _Book, Regular, Roman, Normal_ or sometimes _Medium_.

{ .extDef}
> The association of other weights within a family to the numerical weight values is intended only to preserve the ordering of darkness within that family. However, the following heuristics tell how the assignment is done in typical cases: > * If the font family already uses a numerical scale with nine values (such as with _OpenType_), the font weights should be mapped directly.
> * If there is both a face labeled _Medium_ and one labeled _Book, Regular, Roman_ or _Normal,_ then the _Medium_ is normally assigned to the '500'.
> * The font labeled "Bold" will often correspond to the weight value '700'.
> * If there are fewer then 9 weights in the family, the default algorithm for filling the "holes" is as follows. If '500' is unassigned, it will be assigned the same font as '400'. If any of the values '600', '700', '800' or '900' remains unassigned, they are assigned to the same face as the next darker assigned keyword, if any, or the next lighter one otherwise. If any of '300', '200' or '100' remains unassigned, it is assigned to the next lighter assigned keyword, if any, or the next darker otherwise.

{ .extDef}
> The following two examples illustrate the process.

## Attributes

### Position
The position of the light source. It is used to orientate the light distribution curves.

### ColourAppearance
Artificial light sources are classified in terms of their color appearance. To the human eye they all appear to be white; the difference can only be detected by direct comparison. Visual performance is not directly affected by differences in color appearance.

### ColourTemperature
The color temperature of any source of radiation is defined as the temperature (in Kelvin) of a black-body or Planckian radiator whose radiation has the same chromaticity as the source of radiation. Often the values are only approximate color temperatures as the black-body radiator cannot emit radiation of every chromaticity value. The color temperatures of the commonest artificial light sources range from less than 3000K (warm white) to 4000K (intermediate) and over 5000K (daylight).

### LuminousFlux
Luminous flux is a photometric measure of radiant flux, i.e. the volume of light emitted from a light source. Luminous flux is measured either for the interior as a whole or for a part of the interior (partial luminous flux for a solid angle). All other photometric parameters are derivatives of luminous flux. Luminous flux is measured in lumens (lm). The luminous flux is given as a nominal value for each lamp.

An _IfcPresentationLayerWithStyle_ extends the presentation layer assignment with capabilities to define visibility control, access control and common style information.
<!-- end of short definition -->

The visibility control allows to define a layer to be either 'on' or 'off', and/or 'frozen' or 'not frozen'. The access control allows to block graphical entities from manipulations by setting a layer to be either 'blocked' or 'not blocked'. Common style information can be given to the layer.

> NOTE Style information assigned to layers is often restricted to 'layer colour', 'curve font', and/or 'curve width'. These styles are assigned by using the _IfcCurveStyle_ within the _LayerStyles_.

> NOTE If a styled item is assigned to a layer using the _IfcPresentationLayerWithStyle_, it inherits the style information from the layer. In this case, it should omit its own style information. If the styled item has style information assigned (such as by _IfcCurveStyle_, _IfcFillAreaStyle_, _IfcTextStyle_, _IfcSurfaceStyle_), then it overrides the style provided by the _IfcPresentationLayerWithStyle_.

> NOTE The _IfcPresentationLayerWithStyle_ extends the presentation_layer_assignment entity as defined in ISO/IS 10303-46:1994, p. 36.

IfcPresentationOrganizationResource
===================================

The schema _IfcPresentationOrganizationResource_ defines the resources used for geometric representations and presentations of styled items. The primary application of this resource is for presenting the annotation occurrences of curve, text, filled area, symbol, and surfaces. The organization resource focuses on the provision of layer assignments and light objects.

The following is within the scope of the presentation resource schemas:

* definition of presentation style attributes for realistic and symbolic visualizations of geometric and non-geometric displayble elements in the product information, including presentation styles for
    * curve
    * text
    * filled area
    * surface
* support of curve styles;
* support of externally defined character fonts and symbols;
* support of pre defined character fonts and symbols;
* support of surface rendering and lighting properties;
* support of textures aüülied to surfaces and csg primitives;
* image control by a layer mechanism.

> NOTE  Some definitions of this resource schema have been adopted from [ISO 10303-46](../content/bibliography.htm#iso-10303-46){ .int-ref}. The _IfcPresentationOrganizationResource_ refers to the clause 4, "Presentation organization" of the standard. The definitions, when quoted from ISO 10303-46, are explicitly excluded from the copyright of this specification.

Type A is basically not used. For completeness the Type A Photometry equals the Type B rotated 90° around the Z-Axis counter clockwise.

### TYPE_B
Type B is sometimes used for floodlights. The B-Plane System has a horizontal axis. B-Angles are valid from -180° to +180° with B 0° at the bottom and B180°/B-180° at the top, β-Angles are valid from -90° to +90°.

<!-- end of short definition -->

The light distribution provides the luminous intensity distribution according to some standardized light distribution curves.

Type | Definition
--- | ---
IfcExternalReference | Light distribution is represented by a standard photometric data file such as Eulumdat, IES, CIBSE TM14.
IfcLightIntensityDistribution | For representing a light distribution directly the following values needs to be given in a table like structure with column and row headings. These headings should contain the angles (C/γ or B/β ) and the table body contains the intensity values, (normally normalized to cd/Klm). The angles can be non- equidistant and the angle steps can be almost any value in the valid range, so a list of all available angles in both directions covers all cases.

# IfcEllipseProfileDef

_IfcEllipseProfileDef_ defines an ellipse as the profile definition used by the swept surface geometry or the swept area solid. It is given by its semi axis attributes and placed within the 2D position coordinate system, established by the _Position_ attribute.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> HISTORY New entity in IFC2x

Figure 1 illustrates parameters for the ellipse profile definition. The parameterized profile defines its own position coordinate system. The underlying coordinate system is defined by the swept surface or swept area solid that uses the profile definition. It is the xy plane of either:

* _IfcSweptSurface.Position_
* _IfcSweptAreaSolid.Position_

Or in case of sectioned spines it is the xy plane of each list member of _IfcSectionedSpine.CrossSectionPositions_. By using offsets of the position location, the parameterized profile can be positioned centric (using x,y offsets = 0.), or at any position relative to the profile. Explicit coordinate offsets are used to define cardinal points (for example, upper-left bound). The location of the position coordinate system defines the center of the ellipse. The _SemiAxis1_ attribute defines the first radius of the ellipse in the direction of the X axis, the _SemiAxis2_ attribute defines the second radius of the ellipse in the direction of the Y axis.

![equal sided L-shape](../../../../figures/ifclshapeprofiledef_layout2.gif)

Figure 2 — Equal L-shape profile

> NOTE The black coordinate axes show the underlying coordinate system of the swept surface or swept area solid

The profile is inserted into the underlying coordinate system of the swept area solid by using the <em>Position</em> attribute. In this example (cardinal point of gravity) the attribute values of <em>IfcAxis2Placement2D</em> are:

```

# IfcMirroredProfileDef

The _IfcMirroredProfileDef_ defines the profile by mirroring the parent profile about the y axis of the parent profile coordinate system. That is, left and right of the parent profile are swapped.
<!-- end of short definition -->

Notes:

_IfcMirroredProfileDef_ is primarily useful together with _IfcCShapeProfileDef_, _IfcLShapeProfileDef_, _IfcUShapeProfileDef_, or _IfcZShapeProfileDef_ as parent profile but can be used with other parent profile types as well.

Mirroring of an _IfcParameterizedProfileDef_ is performed after translation and rotation according to its _Position_ attribute. For example, if the parent profile's _Position_ offsets it by half of its width to the right, then the mirrored profile will be offset by half of its width to the left.

Mirroring about the x axis, i.e. swapping top and bottom, can be achieved by mirroring about the y axis coupled with 180 degree rotation about the z axis. In general, rotation happens in a containing object such as _IfcSweptAreaSolid_, i.e. after mirroring by _IfcMirroredProfileDef_ was performed. If the parent profile is an _IfcParameterizedProfileDef_, rotation can alternatively happen already in the parent profile by means of its _Position_ attribute, i.e. before mirroring by _IfcMirroredProfileDef_ was performed.

# IfcParameterizedProfileDef

The parameterized profile definition defines a 2D position coordinate system to which the parameters of the different profiles relate to. All profiles are defined centric to the origin of the position coordinate system, or more specific, the origin [0.,0.] shall be in the center of the bounding box of the profile.
<!-- end of short definition -->

The _Position_ attribute of _IfcParameterizedProfileDef_ is used to position the profile within the XY plane of the underlying coordinate system of the swept surface geometry, the swept area solid or the sectioned spine. It can be used to position the profile at any point which becomes the origin [0.,0.,0.] of the extruded or rotated surface or solid.

The _Position_ attribute should not be used if the transformation can be specified in a containing object instead. In particular, this applies if the _IfcParameterizedProfileDef_ is referenced as _SweptArea_ in subtypes of _IfcSweptAreaSolid_ or as _CrossSections_ in _IfcSectionedSpine_.

Several subtypes of _IfcParameterizedProfileDef_ provide shape parameters which are optional. Sending systems should always provide values for these parameters if possible. If these parameters are left unspecified, receiving systems may retrieve values for them by external reference (if a reference to an external document or library is given; see guidance at _IfcProfileDef_), or estimate them, or simply assume zero values.

# IfcProfileDef

_IfcProfileDef_ is the supertype of all definitions of standard and arbitrary profiles within IFC. It is used to define a standard set of commonly used section profiles by their parameters or by their explicit curve geometry.
<!-- end of short definition -->

* Parameterized profiles are 2D primitives, which are used within the industry to describe cross sections by a description of its parameters.
* Arbitrary profiles are cross sections defined by an outer boundary as bounded curve, which may also include holes, defined by inner boundaries.
* Derived profiles, based on a transformation of a parent profile, are also part of the profile definitions available.
* In addition composite profiles can be defined, which include two or more profile definitions to define the resulting profile.

> HISTORY New entity in IFC1.5, the capabilities have been extended in IFC2x. Profiles can now support swept surfaces and swept area solids with inner boundaries. It had been renamed from IfcAttDrivenProfileDef.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE Changed from ABSTRACT to non-abstract for uses which do not require an explicitly defined geometry. Added inverse attributes _HasProperties_ and _HasExternalReference_.

**Use in material association**

Beams, columns, and similarly shaped building elements and their type objects may be associated with a section profile definition, combined with material definition, by means of _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_ together with _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ and _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_. This way, building elements and element types with same section and material can share a common section profile definition and association.

The profile definition in material association is required to be consistent with shape representations of the respective building elements.

A higher-level description of spatial alignment of the section profile of a member (such as centered, bottom-left, in the geometric centroid, and more) can be provided within _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_ by means of a cardinal point reference. This can be used redundant to geometric data in order to convey design intent.

**Use in shape models**

Profile definitions are used within the geometry and geometric model resource to create either swept surfaces, swept area solids, or sectioned spines.

The purpose of the profile definition within the swept surfaces or swept area solids is to define a uniform cross section being swept:

* along a line (extrusion) using _IfcSurfaceOfLinearExtrusion_ or _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_
* along a circular arc (revolution) using _IfcSurfaceOfRevolution_ or _IfcRevolvedAreaSolid_
* along a directrix lying on a reference surface using _IfcSurfaceCurveSweptAreaSolid_

The purpose of the profile definition within the sectioned spine is to define a varying cross sections at several positions along a spine curve. The subtype _IfcDerivedProfileDef_ is particularly suited to provide the consecutive profiles to be based on transformations of the start profile and thus maintaining the identity of vertices and edges.

> NOTE Subtypes of the _IfcProfileDef_ contain parameterized profiles (as subtypes of _IfcParameterizedProfileDef_) which establish their own 2D position coordinate system, profiles given by explicit curve geometry (either open or closed profiles) and two special types for composite profiles and derived profiles, based on a 2D Cartesian transformation.

An _IfcProfileDef_ is treated as bounded area if it is used within swept area solids. In this case, the inside of the profile is part of the profile. The attribute _ProfileType_ is set to AREA. An _IfcProfileDef_ is treated as a curve if it is used within swept surfaces. In this case, the inside of the profile (if the curve is closed) is not part of the profile. The attribute _ProfileType_ is set to CURVE.

Figure 1 and Figure 2 illustrates use of parameterized profiles within a swept area solid.

![Example of standard profile definition](../../../../figures/ifcprofiledef-layout1.gif)

Figure 1 — Example of standard profile definition

The <em>IfcProfileDef</em> is defined within the underlying coordinate system which is defined by the swept surface or swept area solid that uses the profile definition. It is the xy plane:

 * of <em>IfcSweptSurface.Position</em> or
 * of <em>IfcSweptAreaSolid.Position</em> or
 * of each list member of <em>IfcSectionedSpine.CrossSectionPositions</em>.

In Figure 1 to the left, the z axis of the position coordinate system points outwards of the drawing plane.

> NOTE The subtype <em>IfcParameterizedProfileDef</em> optionally provides an additional 2D position coordinate system relative to the underlying coordinate system of the <em>IfcProfileDef</em>.

![use within swept area solids](../../../../figures/ifcprofiledef-layout5.gif)

Figure 2 — Use within swept area solids

In the later use of the <em>IfcProfileDef</em> within the swept surface or swept area solid, e.g. the <em>IfcExtrudedAreaSolid</em> (here used as an example), the profile boundaries (here based on the 2D position coordinate system of <em>IfcParameterizedProfileDef</em>) are placed within the xy plane of the 3D position coordinate system of the swept surface or swept area solid.

The profile is inserted into the underlying coordinate system either:

 * directly in case of using <em>IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef</em> and <em>IfcArbitraryOpenProfileDef</em>,
 * through an intermediate position coordinate system in case of using <em>IfcParameterizedProfileDef</em>.
 * through an 2D Cartesian transformation operator (applied directly to the curve position when using arbitrary profile definitions, or applied to the position coordinate system when using parameterized profile definitions) in case of using <em>IfcDerivedProfileDef</em>.
 * when using <em>IfcCompositeProfileDef</em> the insertion depends on the subtype of the included sub-profiles.

**Profile types**

Results of the different usage of the _ProfileType_ attribute are demonstrated here. The _ProfileType_ defines whether the inside (the bounded area) is part of the profile definition (Area) or not (Curve). Figure 3 and Figure 4 illustrates the resulting area or curve depending on _ProfileType_.

![AREA profile type without thickness](../../../../figures/ifcprofiledef-layout3.gif)

Figure 3 — AREA profile type without thickness

![CURVE profile type with a closed curve](../../../../figures/ifcprofiledef-layout4.gif)

Figure 4 — CURVE profile type with a closed curve


**Profile specification by external reference**

If the profile is standardized by a norm or a catalogue, a reference to this norm or catalogue should be provided by means of _HasExternalReference_. This inverse relationship is used to associate an _IfcExternalReference_ (notably _IfcClassificationReference_ or _IfcLibraryReference_) with the profile.

_IfcClassificationReference_ is used to refer to a profile norm (a common standard or manufacturer's standard). In this case,

* _IfcClassificationReference.ItemReference_ contains the formal profile designation from the norm. (On the other hand, _IfcProfileDef.ProfileName_ contains a displayable name which may not necessarily be the same as the formal designation.)
* _IfcClassificationReference.Name_ carries the short name of the profile norm.
* Optionally, the norm can be further described by _IfcClassificationReference.ReferencedSource_.

_IfcLibraryReference_ is used to refer to a library which contains profile definitions. In this case,

* _IfcLibraryReference.ItemReference_ contains the identifier of the profile within the library and is meant to be machine-readable (in contrast to _IfcProfileDef.ProfileName_ which should be human-readable).
* _IfcLibraryReference.Location_ and ._Name_ or ._ReferencedLibrary_ further describe the library.

If an external reference is provided, sending systems shall ensure that the shape of the profile definition object agrees with the definitions in the referenced classification or library.

**Direct instances of _IfcProfileDef_**

Usually, only subtypes of _IfcProfileDef_ should be instantiated. In some special cases, e.g. if the profile object is used for purposes other than geometric models (e.g. for structural analysis models), it may be possible to directly instantiate _IfcProfileDef_ and further specify the profile only by external reference or by profile properties. The latter are tracked by the inverse attribute _HasProperties_.

## Attributes

### ProfileType
Defines the type of geometry into which this profile definition shall be resolved, either a curve or a surface area. In case of curve the profile should be referenced by a swept surface, in case of area the profile should be referenced by a swept area solid.

### ProfileName
Human-readable name of the profile, for example according to a standard profile table. As noted above, machine-readable standardized profile designations should be provided in _IfcExternalReference.ItemReference_.

### HasExternalReference
Reference to external information, e.g. library, classification, or document information, which is associated with the profile.

IfcProfileResource
==================

The schema _IfcProfileResource_ defines the two dimensional profiles or cross sections, used to define geometric shape representations. Profile definitions are applied to:

* swept surfaces
* swept area solids
* sectioned spines

> NOTE  Profile definitions are not subtypes of geometric representation item and can not be used directly to geometrically represent an object.

Profiles can be used to either define a curve or an area. In case of a curve, only the boundary is in the domain of the profile definition, in case of an area the boundary and the inside is in the domain of the profile definition. A curve can be used for

* swept surfaces
* sectioned spines

and an area can be used for

* swept area solids
* sectioned spines

> NOTE  The use of profile definitions is the preferred way to define prismatic shapes to represent products.

The profile definition (_IfcProfileDef_) can be instantiated by the various subtypes. There are four different groups of profile definitions:

* parametrically defined profiles, these profiles are defined by a 2D position coordinate system and dimension parameters to generate a 2D form.
* explicitly defined profiles, these profiles are defined by a (single or multiple) 2D curve(s) defined in the parent coordinate system.
* derived profiles, these profiles are created by a Cartesian transformation of a parent profile.
* composite profiles, these profiles are compositions of other profiles

When used as the curve or area to be swept into a surface or solid, the 2D coordinate system of the profile is mapped into the xy plane of the 3D coordinate system of the swept surface (subtypes of _IfcSweptSurface_), the swept area solid (subtypes of _IfcSweptAreaSolid_), or the sectioned spine (_IfcSectionedSpine_). The extrusion direction is along the z axis of the 3D coordinate system (or an extrusion vector being not perpendicular to the z axis, or a rotation that has a tangent into the z axis at the point of origin).

The use of coordinate axes in IFC is not identical with the general convention for the use of coordinate axes in structural analysis. The following conversion should be used, as shown in Table 1:

|IFC axes convention|Structural analysis axes convention|
|--- |--- |
|+X|-Y|
|+Y|-Z|
|+Z|+X|

A set point value can be provided in addition to the upper and lower bound values for operational value setting.
<!-- end of short definition -->

The unit is handled by the _Unit_ attribute, see Table 1 for an example of a bounded property:

* If the _Unit_ attribute is given, then the unit assigned by the _Unit_ attribute overrides the globally assigned unit.

The _IfcPropertyBoundedValue_ allows for the specification of an interval for the value component of the property description. If either the _LowerBoundValue_ or the _UpperBoundValue_ is not given, then it indicates an open bound (either a minimum value or a maximum value). The interval is by definition inclusive, that is, the value given for the _LowerBoundValue_ or the _UpperBoundValue_ is included in the interval.

# IfcPropertyEnumeratedValue

A property with an enumerated value, _IfcPropertyEnumeratedValue_, defines a property object which has a value assigned that is chosen from an enumeration. It defines a property - value combination for which the property _Name_, an optional _Description_, the optional _EnumerationValues_ with measure type and optionally an _Unit_ is given.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> NOTE Multiple choices from the property enumeration are supported.

The unit is handled by the _Unit_ attribute, see Table 1 for an example of a enumerated property:

* If the _Unit_ attribute is not given, then the unit is already implied by the type of _IfcMeasureValue_ or _IfcDerivedMeasureValue_. The associated unit can be found at the _IfcUnitAssignment_ globally defined at the project level (_IfcProject.UnitsInContext_).
* If the _Unit_ attribute is given, then the unit assigned by the unit attribute overrides the globally assigned unit.

More precisely: The _IfcPropertyEnumeratedValue_ defines a property, which value is selected from a defined list of enumerators. The enumerators are stored in a dynamic enumeration of values including the type information from _IfcValue_ (see _IfcPropertyEnumeration_). This enables applications to use an enumeration value as a property within a property set (_IfcPropertySet_) including the allowed list of values.

> NOTE An _IfcPropertyEnumeratedValue_ may be exchanged with no values assigned yet. In this case the _EnumerationValues_ are set to NIL.

# IfcPropertyEnumeration

_IfcPropertyEnumeration_ is a collection of simple or measure values that define a prescribed set of alternatives from which 'enumeration values' are selected. This enables inclusion of enumeration values in property sets. _IfcPropertyEnumeration_ provides a name for the enumeration as well as a list of unique (numeric or descriptive) values (that may have a measure type assigned). The entity defines the list of potential enumerators to be exchanged together (or separately) with properties of type _IfcPropertyEnumeratedValue_ that selects their actual property values from this enumeration.
<!-- end of short definition -->

The unit is handled by the _Unit_ attribute, see Table 1 for an example of a unitless property enumeration:

* If the _Unit_ attribute is not given, than the unit is already implied by the type of _IfcMeasureValue_ or _IfcDerivedMeasureValue_. The associated unit can be found at the _IfcUnitAssignment_ globally defined at the project level (_IfcProject.UnitsInContext_).
* If the _Unit_ attribute is given, the unit assigned by the unit attribute overrides the globally assigned unit.

# IfcPropertyTableValue

_IfcPropertyTableValue_ is a property with a value range defined by a property object which has two lists of (numeric or descriptive) values assigned. The values specify a table with two columns. The defining values provide the first column and establish the scope for the defined values (the second column). An optional _Expression_ attribute may give the equation used for deriving the range value, which is for information purposes only.
<!-- end of short definition -->

The _IfcPropertyTableValue_ defines a defining/defined property value combination for which the property name, the table with defining and defined values with measure type (and optional the units for defining and defined values) are given.

> NOTE The _IfcPropertyTableValue_ only captures properties that can be expressed by a table with two columns. Use IfcPropertyReferenceValue with the PropertyReference being an IfcTable to express all those properties that require a table with tree or more columns.

The units are handled by the _DefiningUnit_ and _DefinedUnit_ attributes, see Table 1 for an example of a table value property:

* If the _DefiningUnit_ or _DefinedUnit_ attribute is not given, then the unit is already implied by the type of _IfcMeasureValue_ or _IfcDerivedMeasureValue_. The associated unit can be found at the _IfcUnitAssignment_ globally defined at the project level (_IfcProject.UnitsInContext_).
* If the _DefiningUnit_ or _DefinedUnit_ attribute is given, then the unit assigned by the unit attribute overrides the globally assigned unit.

The _IfcPropertyTableValue_ allows for the specification of a table of defining/defined value pairs of the property description. The optional attribute _CurveInterpolation_ allows to determine the interval between two given values.

IfcPropertyResource
===================

The _IfcPropertyResource_ defines a basic set of property types that can be associated with occurrence objects (subtypes of _IfcObject_) and type objects (subtypes of _IfcTypeObject_) through the _IfcPropertySet_ (defined in the _IfcKernel_ schema). These properties are used to assign property definitions that are semantically defined by a name string and are extensible in terms of their definitions.

> NOTE  Frequently, there is a need to extend the attributes that are attached to an individual object or group of objects. Yet it may not be necessary to extend the attributes for every object within the same class. Using the same capabilities as for types of an element, it is possible to define such sets of attributes and associate them with individual objects.

The association of attributes to objects can be defined by two different ways:

* by defining a type object (_IfcTypeObject_) which defines a specific object information (including the relevant properties) that is assigned to all instances (or occurrences) of the type object (via the _IfcRelDefinesByType_ relationship).
* by defining a property set (_IfcPropertySet_, a logical grouping of related properties) which defines the common property information for an individual instance (or occurrence), this is done via the _IfcRelDefinesByProperties_ relationship.

The semantic information of what an individual property denotes has to be given by the _Name_ attribute. The _Name_ is human interpretable and can also be computer interpretable by convention. This convention has to be established by implementers' agreements.

> NOTE  The IFC specification defines a set of property sets, which provides a recommended usage of property sets for objects in the IFC model. In addition to the IFC property set specification also regional or project specific definitions of property sets are possible. Thereby property sets provide an mechanism to localize IFC definitions.

All subtypes of _IfcProperty_ are referenced later by the _IfcPropertySet_. Thereby the _IfcPropertySet_ establishes a tree of property definitions through the _IfcSimpleProperty_ (and its subtypes) and _IfcComplexProperty_. Any instance of _IfcSimpleProperty_ within this tree shall only be referenced once (by either _IfcPropertySet_ or _IfcComplexProperty_).

> NOTE  The property set attached to an object shall have a tree structure, therefore all properties (either _IfcSimpleProperty_ -and subtypes- or _IfcComplexProperty_) shall be used only once within that structure.

An _IfcCoordinateOperation_ allows to connect:
- an _IfcGeometricRepresentationContext_ – a reference system of a virtual model
- to an _IfcCoordinateReferenceSystem_ – the coordinate system which is related to the real world by datums.

> EXAMPLE This can is done by setting:
> - the _IfcCoordinateOperation.SourceCRS_ to _IfcGeometricRepresentationContext_
> - the _IfcCoordinateOperation.TargetCRS_ either to:
>  -	_IfcProjectedCRS_, for defined easting, northing and orthogonal height
>  -	_IfcGeographicCRS_, for defined latitude, longitude and ellipsoidal height

> NOTE _IfcProjectedCRS_ can be used to represent a projected CRS or a compound CRS, comprising of a projected CRS with a vertical CRS. See _IfcProjectedCRS_ for further details.

{ .extDef}
> NOTE Definition from OpenGIS Abstract Specification, Topic 2:
> If the relationship between any two coordinate reference systems is known, coordinates can be transformed or converted to another coordinate reference system. Coordinate operations are divided into two subtypes:
>
> * _Coordinate conversion_ – mathematical operation on coordinates that does not include any change of datum. The best-known example of a coordinate conversion is a map projection. The parameters describing coordinate conversions are defined rather than empirically derived. Note that some conversions have no parameters.
>
> * _Coordinate transformation_ – mathematical operation on coordinates that usually includes a change of datum. The parameters of a coordinate transformation are empirically derived from data containing the coordinates of a series of points in both coordinate reference systems. This computational process is usually ‘over-determined’, allowing derivation of error (or accuracy) estimates for the transformation. Also, the stochastic nature of the parameters may result in multiple (different) versions of the same coordinate transformation. Because of this several transformations may exist for a given pair of coordinate reference systems, differing in their transformation method, parameter values and accuracy characteristics.

There are three types of _IfcCoordinateOperation_. The one to be used depends on the specific use case:

* _IfcMapConversion_ and _IfcMapConversionScaled_ involve a **transformation**. These coordinate operations convey that the local engineering coordinate system of the virtual model (which is a topocentric CRS) is put in place in the referenced _IfcProjectedCRS_. 

* _IfcRigidOperation_ involves a **translation** in the 3D space. This coordinate operation convey that the whole virtual model is translated in the same way. For example, using lengths to translate along x,y,z; or using angles for a 2D translation (e.g., lambda, phi), plus a change in height.

# IfcCoordinateReferenceSystem

The _IfcCoordinateReferenceSystem_ is a definition of a coordinate reference system by means of qualified identifiers only. The interpretation of the identifier is expected to be well-known to the receiving software.
<!-- end of short definition -->

{ .extDef}
> NOTE Definition from OpenGIS Abstract Specification, Topic 2:
> A coordinate reference system is a coordinate system which is related to the real world by a datum. The coordinate system is composed of a set of coordinate axes with specified units of measure. The datum specifies the relationship of a coordinate system to the earth. The resulting combination of coordinate system and datum is a coordinate reference system.

The unambiguous identifier by which the coordinate reference system is know, is stored in the _Name_ attribute. Well defined identifiers include the geodetic and the vertical CRS, each with its own datum. In these cases the _GeodeticDatum_ can be omitted.

> EXAMPLE The code 'EPSG:5555' identifies the combination of *ETRS89 / UTM zone 32N + DHHN92 height* (i.e., a projected CRS + a vertical CRS). The code **'EPSG:6258'** identifies the **geodetic datum** of the projected CRS *ETRS89 / UTM zone 32N* (itself identified as EPSG:25832). The code **'EPSG:5181'** identifies the **vertical datum** of the vertical CRS *DHHN92 height* (itself identified as EPSG:5783).

> NOTE One widely-used, publicly-available authority is the European Petroleum Survey Group (EPSG), and use of this authority is currently specified in several OGC Implementation Specifications. Software used to transport IFC engineering models into GIS applications (and vice versa) is expected to have knowledge about the OGC Implementation Specifications.

# IfcGeometricRepresentationContext

The _IfcGeometricRepresentationContext_ defines the context that applies to several shape representations of products within a project. It defines the type of the context in which the shape representation is defined, and the numeric precision applicable to the geometric representation items defined in this context. In addition it can be used to offset the project coordinate system from a global point of origin, using the _WorldCoordinateSystem_ attribute. The main representation context may also provide the true north direction, see Figure 1.
<!-- end of short definition -->

![TrueNorth](../../../../figures/ifcgeometricrepresentationcontext_truenorth.png)

Figure 1 — Definition of the true north direction

The <em>TrueNorth</em> attribute should be provided, if the y axis of the <em>WorldCoordinateSystem</em> does not point to the global northing. Direction of the true north, or geographic northing direction, relative to the underlying project coordinate system as established by the attribute <em>WorldCoordinateSystem</em>. It is given by a 2 dimensional direction within the xy-plane of the project coordinate system. If not resent, it defaults to [0.,1.] - i.e. the positive Y axis of the project coordinate system equals the geographic northing direction. The direction is provided within project coordinate system and identifies the true north direction.</p>

The "true North as seen in CAD" within Figure 1 shows the correct interpretation of the <em>TrueNorth</em> direction.

If a conversion to a geographic coordinate system is included by virtue of the <em>HasCoordinateOperation</em> attribute, then the <em>TrueNorth</em> attribute shall be omitted or included only for informational purposes. It shall not be added to any transformation already applied by an <em>IfcCoordinateOperation</em>.</p>

The use of one instance of _IfcGeometricRepresentationContext_ to represent the model (3D) view is mandatory, the use of a second instance of _IfcGeometricRepresentationContext_ to represent the plan (2D) view is optional (but needs to be given, if there are scale dependent plan views), the additional scale or view dependent contexts need to be handled by using the subtype _IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext_ pointing to the model view (or the plan view) as the _ParentContext_. See Figure 2 for an example using geometric representation contexts for 3D and 2D with assigned sub contexts.

## Attributes

### CoordinateSpaceDimension
The integer dimension count of the coordinate space modeled in a geometric representation context.

### Precision
Value of the model precision for geometric models. It is a double value (REAL), typically in 1E-5 to 1E-8 range, that indicates the tolerance under which two given points are still assumed to be identical. The value can be used e.g. to sets the maximum distance from an edge curve to the underlying face surface in brep models.

### WorldCoordinateSystem
Establishment of the engineering coordinate system (often referred to as the world coordinate system in CAD) for all representation contexts used by the project.

> NOTE It can be used to provide better numeric stability if the placement of the building(s) is far away from the origin. In most cases however it would be set to origin: (0.,0.,0.) and directions x(1.,0.,0.), y(0.,1.,0.), z(0.,0.,1.).



If an geographic placement is provided using _IfcMapConversion_ then the _WorldCoordinateSystem_ atttibute is used to define the offset between the zero point of the local engineering coordinate system and the geographic reference point to which the _IfcMapConversion_ offset relates. In preferred practise both points (also called "project base point" and "survey point") should be coincidental. However it is possible to offset the geographic reference point from the local zero point.

### TrueNorth
Direction of the true north, or geographic northing direction, relative to the underlying project coordinate system. It is given by a 2 dimensional direction within the xy-plane of the project coordinate system. If not present, it defaults to 0. 1., meaning that the positive Y axis of the project coordinate system equals the geographic northing direction.

> NOTE If a geographic placement is provided using _IfcMapConversion_ then the true north is for information only. In case of inconsistency, the value provided with _IfcMapConversion_ shall take precedence.

### HasSubContexts
The set of _IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContexts_ that refer to this _IfcGeometricRepresentationContext_.

### HasCoordinateOperation
Indicates conversion between coordinate systems. In particular it refers to an _IfcCoordinateOperation_ between a Geographic map coordinate reference system, and the engineering coordinate system of this construction project. If there is more then one _IfcGeometricRepresentationContext_ provided to the _IfcProject_ then all contexts shall have an identical instance of _IfcCoordinateOperation_ as _HasCoordinateOperation_ referring to the same instance of _IfcCoordinateReferenceSystem_.

# IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext

_IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext_ defines the context that applies to several shape representations of a product being a sub context, sharing the _WorldCoordinateSystem_, _CoordinateSpaceDimension_, _Precision_ and _TrueNorth_ attributes with the parent _IfcGeometricRepresentationContext_.
<!-- end of short definition -->

The _IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext_ is used to define semantically distinguished representation types for different information content, dependent on the representation view and the target scale. It can be used to control the level of detail of the shape representation that is most applicable to this geometric representation context. In addition the sub context is used to control the later appearance of the _IfcShapeRepresentation_ within a plot view.

> NOTE If the _IfcShapeRepresentation_ using this sub context has_IfcStyledItem_'s assigned to the _Items_, the presentation style information (e.g. _IfcCurveStyle_, _IfcTextStyle_) associated with the _IfcStyledItem_ is given in target plot dimensions. For example, a line thickness (_IfcCurveStyle.CurveWidth_) is given by a thickness measure relating to the thickness for a plot within the (range of) target scale.

Each _IfcProduct_ can then have several instances of subtypes of _IfcRepresentation_, each being assigned to a different _IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext_). The applicable values for the inherited _ContextIdentifier_ attribute shall be identical to the _RepresentationIdentifier_ attribute defined at _IfcShapeRepresentation_.

> NOTE The provision of a model view (_IfcGeometricRepresentationContext.ContextType_ = 'Model') is mandatory. Instances of _IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext_ relate to it as its _ParentContext_.

> EXAMPLE Instances of _IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext_ can be used to handle the multi-view blocks or macros, which are used in CAD programs to store several scale and/or view dependent geometric representations of the same object. The application can then choose the most appropriate representation for showing the geometric shape of the product, depending on the target view and scale.

# IfcMapConversion

The map conversion deals with transforming the local engineering coordinate system, often called world coordinate system, into the coordinate reference system of the underlying map.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> NOTE The _IfcMapConversion_ does not handle the projection of a map from the geodetic coordinate reference system.

For this transformation, _IfcMapConversion_ data are used for:
1. a scaling of the three axes (x,y,z), by the same _IfcMapConversion.Scale_
2. followed by an **anti-clockwise** rotation about the z-axis of *θ*, where:

$$
\theta=arctan\left(\frac{XAxisOrdinate}{XAxisAbscissa}\right)
$$

3. and then a translation in (x,y,z) of _IfcMapConversion.Eastings_, _IfcMapConversion.Northings_, _IfcMapConversion.OrthogonalHeight_

With _IfcMapConversion_, **one scale** is applied equally to x, y and z, **to convert units**.
With _IfcMapConversionScaled_, additional **different factors** multiply x, y and z, to **scale coordinates** - not units.

> NOTE The z-axis of the local engineering coordinate system is always parallel to the z-axis of the map coordinate system.

> NOTE The *Scale* can be used when the length unit for the 3 axes of the map coordinate system are not identical with the length unit established for this project (see _IfcProject.UnitsInContext_) - for example to convert feet into metres. If omitted, the scale factor 1.0 is assumed.

# IfcProjectedCRS

_IfcProjectedCRS_ is a coordinate reference system (CRS) of the map to which the map translation of the local engineering coordinate system of the construction or facility engineering project relates.

* If the referenced _IfcGeometricRepresentationContext_ is 2D, then _IfcProjectedCRS_ can be either a **projected coordinate reference system** or a **compound coordinate reference system**.

> EXAMPLE The code EPSG:9286 (ETRS89 + NAP height) is the combination of a geographic CRS (ETRS89) and a vertical CRS (NAP height), with their respective datums.

> EXAMPLE The code EPSG:9306 (HS2 Survey Grid + HS2-VRF height) is the combination of a projected CRS (HS2 Survey Grid), and a vertical CRS (HS2-VRF height), with their respective datums.

> A representation is a collection of one or more representation items that are related in a specified representation context. The relationship of representation item to representation context is the basis for distinguishing which representation item entities are related. A representation item can be related to a representation context directly, when it occurs as an element is a representation, or indirectly, when it is referenced through any number of intervening entities, each of type representation item.

Representation Use Definition

Each representation, either _IfcShapeRepresentation_, or _IfcTopologyRepresentation_ shall have a well defined:

* _ContextOfItems_: Reference to an _IfcGeometricRepresentationContext_ as agreed for this representation.
* _RepresentationIdentifier_: Name of the representation, for example, 'Body' for 3D shape, 'FootPrint' for 2D ground view, 'Axis' for reference axis.
* _RepresentationType_: Name for the geometric, or topological representation type, for example, 'SweptSolid' for 3D swept solids, 'Brep' for boundary representation.

> NOTE Guidelines for applying correct values to those attributes are provided in the geometry use definition section at each subtype of _IfcElement_. These guidelines can be further refined in view definitions or implementer agreements.

## Attributes

### ContextOfItems
Definition of the representation context for which the different subtypes of representation are valid.

### RepresentationIdentifier
The optional identifier of the representation as used within a project.

### RepresentationType
The description of the type of a representation context. The representation type defines the type of geometry or topology used for representing the product representation. More information is given at the subtypes _IfcShapeRepresentation_ and _IfcTopologyRepresentation_.
The supported values for context type are to be specified by implementers agreements.

### Items
Set of geometric representation items that are defined for this representation.

### RepresentationMap
Use of the representation within an _IfcRepresentationMap_. If used, this _IfcRepresentation_ may be assigned to many representations as one of its _Items_ using an _IfcMappedItem_. Using _IfcRepresentationMap_ is the way to share one representation (often of type _IfcShapeRepresentation_) by many products.

### LayerAssignments
Assignment of the whole representation to a single or multiple layer(s). The _LayerAssigments_ can be overridden by _LayerAssigments_ of the _IfcRepresentationItem_'s within the list of _Items_.
> NOTE Implementation agreements can restrict the maximum number of layer assignments to 1.

# IfcRigidOperation

A rigid operation specifies an offset in the coordinate reference system. It does not specify any conversion or distortion. It is a coordinate operation that tells that the whole virtual model is **translated** in the same way. For example, using lengths to translate along x,y,z; or using angles for a 2D translation (e.g., lambda, phi), plus a change in height.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> EXAMPLE If data is in truncated map coordinates (i.e., the map coordinates have the leading digits removed in x and y), then _IfcRigidOperation_ simply translates the data in x and y to replace the ignored leading digits. This is also known as subtraction.

## Attributes

### FirstCoordinate

The first coordinate of the translation. Can be a length measure in case of map coordinates or a plane angle measure in case of geographic reference systems.

### SecondCoordinate

The second coordinate of the translation. Can be a length measure in case of map coordinates or a plane angle measure in case of geographic reference systems.

### Height

Translation above (positive) or below (negative) the coordinate surface.

> NOTE In case of _IfcGeographicCRS_, *Height* is a translation relative to the geodetic datum ellipsoid's surface. In case of a _IfcProjectedCRS_, *Height* is a translation relative to the vertical datum.

The word or group of words by which the shape aspect is known. It is a tag to indicate the particular semantic of a component within the product definition shape, used to provide meaning. Example: use the tag "Glazing" to define which component of a window shape defines the glazing area.

### Description
The word or group of words that characterize the shape aspect. It can be used to add additional meaning to the name of the aspect.

IfcRepresentationResource
=========================

This schema defines the representation of shape and topology as important definitional properties for products defined within the IFC Object Model. The representations characterize certain properties of a product, and any product can be defined by zero, one, or many of those properties. The schema defines two ways to represent definitional properties of products:

* topological representation
* geometric shape representation
* geo referencing, providing the real map coordinate location of an element in accord with GIS practice,

The geometric shape representation allows for

* multiple shape representations for the same product definition shape of a product
* separate shape representations for components or parts of the product definition shape by using shape aspects

> A closed shell is a shell of the dimensionality 2 which typically serves as a bound for a region in R3. A closed shell has no boundary, and has non-zero finite extent. If the shell has a domain with coordinate space R3, it divides that space into two connected regions, one finite and the other infinite. In this case, the topological normal of the shell is defined as being directed from the finite to the infinite region.
>
> The shell is represented by a collection of faces. The domain of the shell, if present, contains all those faces, together with their bounds. Associated with each face in the shell is a logical value which indicates whether the face normal agrees with (TRUE) or is opposed to (FALSE) the shell normal. The logical value can be applied directly as a BOOLEAN attribute of an oriented face, or be defaulted to TRUE if the shell boundary attribute member is a face without the orientation attribute.
>
> The combinatorial restrictions on closed shells and geometrical restrictions on their domains are designed to ensure that any domain associated with a closed shell is a closed, orientable manifold. The domain of a closed shell, if present, is a connected, closed, oriented 2-manifold. It is always topologically equivalent to an _H_-fold torus for some _H_ ≥ 0. The number _H_ is referred to as the surface genus of the shell. If a shell of genus _H_ has a domain within coordinate space _R^3^_, then the finite region of space inside it is topologically equivalent to a solid ball with _H_ tunnels drilled through it.

> The Euler equation applies with _B_=0, because in this case there are no holes. As in the case of open shells, the surface genus _H_ may not be known a priori, but shall be an integer ≥ 0. Thus a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a well-formed closed shell is the following:

# IfcEdge

An _IfcEdge_ defines two vertices being connected topologically. The geometric representation of the connection between the two vertices defaults to a straight line if no curve geometry is assigned using the subtype _IfcEdgeCurve_. The _IfcEdge_ can therefore be used to exchange straight edges without an associated geometry provided by _IfcLine_ or _IfcPolyline_ thought _IfcEdgeCurve.EdgeGeometry_.

> EXAMPLE Figure 1 illustrates an example where the bounds of the <em>IfcEdge</em> are given by the <em>EdgeStart</em> and <em>EdgeEnd</em>; this also determines the direction of the edge. The location within a coordinate space is determined by the <em>IfcVertexPoint</em> type for <em>EdgeStart</em> and <em>EdgeEnd</em>. Since no edge geometry is assigned, it defaults to a straight line agreeing to the direction sense.

{ .extDef}
> NOTE Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992
> An edge is the topological construct corresponding to the connection of two vertices. More abstractly, it may stand for a logical relationship between two vertices. The domain of an edge, if present, is a finite, non-self-intersecting open curve in _R^M^_, that is, a connected 1-dimensional manifold. The bounds of an edge are two vertices, which need not be distinct. The edge is oriented by choosing its traversal direction to run from the first to the second vertex. If the two vertices are the same, the edge is a self loop. The domain of the edge does not include its bounds, and 0 ≤ Ξ ≤ ∞. Associated with an edge may be a geometric curve to locate the edge in a coordinate space; this is represented by the edge curve subtype. The curve shall be finite and non-self-intersecting within the domain of the edge. An edge is a graph, so its multiplicity M and graph genus _G^e^_ may be determined by the graph traversal algorithm. Since _M_ = _E_ = 1, the Euler equation (1) reduces in the case to:

> EXAMPLE Figure 1 illustrates an example where the edge geometry is given by an unbounded curve, here <em>IfcCircle</em>.

> NOTE Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992
> An edge curve is a special subtype of edge which has its geometry fully defined. The geometry is defined by associating the edge with a curve which may be unbounded. As the topological and geometric directions may be opposed, an indicator (same sense) is used to identify whether the edge and curve directions agree or are opposed. The Boolean value indicates whether the curve direction agrees with (TRUE) or is in the opposite direction (FALSE) to the edge direction. Any geometry associated with the vertices of the edge shall be consistent with the edge geometry. Multiple edges can reference the same curve.

> NOTE Entity adapted from **edge_curve** defined in ISO 10303-42.

> HISTORY New entity in IFC2x.

**Informal Propositions**

1. The domain of the edge curve is formally defined to be the domain of its edge geometry as trimmed by the vertices. This domain does not include the vertices.
2. An edge curve has non-zero finite extent.
3. An edge curve is a manifold.
4. An edge curve is arcwise connected.
5. The edge start is not a part of the edge domain.
6. The edge end is not a part of the edge domain.
7. Vertex geometry shall be consistent with edge geometry.

## Attributes

### EdgeGeometry
The curve which defines the shape and spatial location of the edge. This curve may be unbounded and is implicitly trimmed by the vertices of the edge; this defines the edge domain. Multiple edges can reference the same curve.

### SameSense
This logical flag indicates whether (TRUE), or not (FALSE) the senses of the edge and the curve defining the edge geometry are the same. The sense of an edge is from the edge start vertex to the edge end vertex; the sense of a curve is in the direction of increasing parameter.

> NOTE Entity adapted from **edge_loop** defined in ISO 10303-42.

> HISTORY New entity in IFC2x2.

**Informal Propositions**

1. The genus of the _IfcEdgeLoop_ shall be 1 or greater.
2. The Euler formula shall be satisfied: (number of vertices) + genus - (number of edges) = 1;
3. No edge may be referenced more than once by the same _IfcEdgeLoop_ with the same sense. For this purpose, an edge which is not an oriented edge is considered to be referenced with the sense TRUE.

## Formal Propositions

### IsClosed
The start vertex of the first edge shall be the same as the end vertex of the last edge. This ensures that the path is closed to form a loop.

# IfcFace

An _IfcFace_ is topological entity used to define surface, bounded by loops, of a shell.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> NOTE In a correctly constructed boundary representation model the face normals will point out of the solid and every single edge is used twice once forwards and once backwards. The face normal is solely defined by the consecutive orientations of the _IfcEdge_'s and _IfcOrientedEdge_'s that bound the face. If all the edges of the face are connected in a counter clockwise manner following the edge orientations the face normal will point outward. The orientation of the _IfcFaceSurface_, or the value of the _IfcFaceSurface.SameSense_ attribute have no effect on the orientation of the face.

{ .extDef}
> NOTE Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992
> A face is a topological entity of dimensionality 2 corresponding to the intuitive notion of a piece of surface bounded by loops. Its domain, if present, is an oriented, connected, finite 2-manifold in _R^m^_. A face domain shall not have handles but it may have holes, each hole bounded by a loop. The domain of the underlying geometry of the face, if present, does not contain its bounds, and 0 < Ξ < ∞.
>
> A face is represented by its bounding loops, which are defined as face bounds. A face has a topological normal n and the tangent to a loop is t. For a loop bounding a face with defined geometry, the cross product n x t points toward the interior of the face. That is, each loop runs counter-clockwise around the face when viewed from above, if we consider the normal n to point up. With each loop is associated a BOOLEAN flag to signify whether the loop direction is oriented with respect to the face normal (TRUE) or should be reversed (FALSE).
>
> A face shall have at least one bound, and the loops shall not intersect. One loop is optionally distinguished as the outer loop of the face. If so, it establishes a preferred way of embedding the face domain in the plane, in which the other bounding loops of the face are inside the outer bound. Because the face domain is arcwise connected, no inner loop will contain any other loop. This is true regardless of which embedding in the plane is chosen.

**Informal Propositions**

1. No edge shall be referenced by the face more than twice.
2. Distinct face bounds of the face shall have no common vertices.
3. If geometry is present, distinct loops of the same face shall not intersect.
4. The face shall satisfy the Euler Equation: (number of vertices) - (number of edges) - (number of loops) + (sum of genus for loops) = 0.

However, the union of the face with the edges and vertices of its bounding loops need not be embeddable in the plane. It may, for example, cover an entire sphere or torus.

# IfcOrientedEdge

The _IfcOrientedEdge_ represents an _IfcEdge_ with an _Orientation_ flag applied. It allows to reuse the same _IfcEdge_ when traversed exactly twice, once forwards and once backwards.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> NOTE The sense of the normal to the _IfcFace_ is solely determined from the edges. If all the edges of the face are connected in a counter clockwise manner following the edge orientations the face normal will point outward. The normal to the underlying _IfcFaceSurface_ representing the geometry of that face has no relevance to this. The purpose of the _IfcFaceSurface.SameSense_ attribute is to give additional information for verification purposes. _SameSense_ TRUE means surface normal and face normal are the same, _SameSense_ FALSE means they are in opposite directions.

The reused edge with a geometric representation as _IfcEdgeCurve_ defines the edge in 3D coordinate space. In some cases, particularly when using elementary or swept surfaces, there is the risk of imprecise mapping of the 3D (x, y, z) _IfcEdgeCurve_ onto the adjacent surfaces to determine the boundaries of these surfaces. The optional _CurveOnSurface_ defines the 2D (u, v) edge within the parametric space of the surface. It could be used to determine the correctness of the mapping of the 3D _IfcEdgeCurve_ onto this surface.

IfcTopologyResource
===================

The schema _IfcTopologyResource_ defines the resources used for topological representations. The primary application of this resource is its use in the Boundary representation of the shape or geometric form of a product model.

> NOTE  The definitions of this resource of the IFC model have been taken from [ISO 10303-42](../content/bibliography.htm#iso-10303-42){ .int-ref}. The IfcTopologyResource refers to the clause 5, "Topology" of the standard. The reference is ISO/IS 10303-42:1994, pp. 122. The improved definitions of the second edition, ISO/DIS 10303-42:1999 have been used, when applicable.

The definitions taken from ISO/IS 10303-42:1994 have undergone an adaptation process, characterized by:

* adaptation of the IFC naming convention (inner majuscules and Ifc prefix)
* adaptation of the ISO 10303 entities, where multiple inheritance or non-exclusive inheritance (that is, AND or ANDOR subtype constraints) are used
* selection of a subset of the IR, using subtype and select pruning
* omission of the name attribute at the representation item

The topological representation of the shape is defined following the adaptation of 10303-42. The type, class, and function semantic definition sections follow the adapted wording of the working draft, which is clearly indicated and quoted at each reference. The definitions on geometric and topological representation (when taken from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992) are explicitly excluded from the copyright of this specification.

{ .note}
> For more information on the definitions as defined in the formal ISO standard please refer to: ISO/IS 10303-42:1994, Industrial Automation Systems and Integration: Product Data Representation and Exchange - Part 42: Integrated Generic Resources. Geometric and Topological Representation. The formal standard can be obtained through the local publishers of standards in each individual country.

The following are within the scope of the topology schema:

* definition of the fundamental topological entities vertex, edge, and face, each with a specialized subtype to enable it to be associated with the geometry of a point, curve, or surface, respectively;
* collections of the basic entities to form topological structures of path, loop and shell and constraints to ensure the integrity of these structures;
* orientation of topological entities.

# IfcTable

An _IfcTable_ is a data structure for the provision of information in the form of rows and columns. Each instance may have _IfcTableColumn_ instances that define the name, description and units for each column. The rows of information are stored as a list of _IfcTableRow_ objects.
<!-- end of short definition -->

Limitation: For backwards compatibility, the rows of an _IfcTable_ object are constrained to have the same number of cells. The first row of the table provides the number of cells. All other rows are forced to include the same number of cells. This is enforced by the WR2.

IfcUtilityResource
==================

The resource schema _IfcUtilityResource_ deals with the general concepts of Ownership and Change. It also includes a basic information construct: Tables. The classes of this schema are referenced throughout the whole IFC Object Model by all of its model layers. The _IfcUtilityResource_ schema consequently contains model specifications for specifying the information content of a number of utility types.

This schema contains the following concepts:

* Ownership
* History
* Table

Each object, relationship and type definition will provide information about their current ownership. Ownership information is the currently "owning" application and the owning (responsible) actor. This ownership information can be used for access and change permissions. Ownership can be transferred from one person to another through the life cycle of a project.

The history of an IFC object is captured simply in the form of last modifying user, application and date.

The table datatype is general purpose and may be used for any two dimensional matrix type document. It allows information to be recorded in rows and columns where each column is labeled with the type of information it contains. The model does not allow for any mathematical operations on the information content of a table (that is, it does not function as a spreadsheet).

> HISTORY  The various types of registries were removed from this schema in IFC2.0 since the method used within applications to store those types of information could differ between different applications.

# IfcChangeActionEnum

_IfcChangeActionEnum_ identifies the type of change that might have occurred to the object during the last session (for example, added, modified, deleted). This information is required in a partial model exchange scenario so that an application or model server will know how an object might have been affected by the previous application. Valid enumerations are:
<!-- end of short definition -->

Consider Application A will create an IFC dataset that it wants to publish to others for modification and have the ability to subsequently merge these changes back into the original model. Before publication, it may want to set the _IfcChangeActionEnum_ to NOCHANGE to establish a baseline so that other application changes can be easily identified. Application B then receives this IFC dataset and adds a new object and sets _IfcChangeActionEnum_ to ADDED with Application B defined as the OwningApplication. Application B then modifies an existing object and (re)defines the LastModifiedDate to the time of the modification, LastModifyingUser to the _IfcPersonAndOrganization_ making the change, and sets the LastModifyingApplication to Application B. When Application A receives this modified dataset, it can determine which objects have been added and modified by Application B and either merge or reject these changes as necessary. Consequently, the intent is that an application only modifies the value of _IfcChangeActionEnum_ when it does something to the object, with the further intent that a model server is responsible for clearing the _IfcChangeActionEnum_ back to NOCHANGE when it is ready to be republished.

# IfcGloballyUniqueId

An _IfcGloballyUniqueId_ holds an encoded string identifier that is used to uniquely identify an IFC object. An _IfcGloballyUniqueId_ is a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) which is an auto-generated 128-bit number. Since this identifier is required for all IFC object instances, it is desirable to compress it to reduce overhead. The encoding of the base 64 character set is shown below:
<!-- end of short definition -->

<pre>
      1     2     3     4     5     6

"0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz_$";
</pre>


The resulting string is a fixed 22 character length string to be exchanged within the IFC exchange file structure.

The base64 encoding process may differ from common base64 implementations. The following steps are used:

 1. The first byte is encoded in the first two characters
 2. The remaining bytes are encoded in groups of 3, taking up 4 characters

As a result, the first character must be either a 0, 1, 2, or 3.

Resource definition data schemas
========================

The resource definition data schemas consist of supporting data structures as shown below. Entities and types defined in this layer can be referenced by all entities in the layers below.

Unlike entities in other layers, resource definition data structures cannot exist independently, but can only exist if referenced (directly or indirectly) by one or more entities deriving from IfcRoot. As resource definitions do not have a concept of identity (such as a GUID), multiple objects referencing the same instance of a resource entity does not imply a relationship. For example, two polylines (IfcPolyline) sharing the same instance for a point (IfcCartesianPoint), and two polylines using different instances for identical points (such as both having cordinates 0,0,0) are semantically equivalent. It is recommended (but not required) for applications to minimize file size by sharing identical resource definition instances where possible.

NOTE  The resource definition layer should not be confused with construction resource entities (IfcResource subtypes). While the terms are similar, they are unrelated concepts.

# IfcBeam

An _IfcBeam_ is typically a horizontal, or nearly horizontal, structural member that is capable of withstanding load primarily by resisting bending. It may also represent such a member from an architectural point of view. It is not required to be load bearing.
<!-- end of short definition -->

There are two main representations for beam occurrences:

 * _IfcBeam_ with _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_ is used for all occurrences of beams, that have a profile defined that is swept along a directrix. The profile might change uniformly by a taper definition along the directrix. The profile parameter and its cardinal point of insertion can be fully described by the _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_. These beams are always represented geometricly by an 'Axis' and a 'SweptSolid' or 'AdvancedSweptSolid' shape representation (or by a 'Clipping' geometry based on the swept solid), if a 3D geometric representation is assigned.
 * _IfcBeam_ without _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_ is used for all other occurrences of beams, particularly for beams with non-uniformly changing profile sizes along the sweep, or beams having only 'AdvancedBrep', 'Brep', or 'SurfaceModel' geometry, if a more parametric representation is not intended.

For any other longitudinal structural member, not constrained to be predominately horizontal nor vertical, or where this semantic information is irrelevant, the entity _IfcMember_ should be used.

> REFERENCE Definition according to ISO 6707-1: structural member for carrying load(s) between or beyond points of support, usually narrow in relation to its length and horizontal or nearly so.

> NOTE The entity _IfcBeamStandardCase_ has been deleted, _IfcBeam_ with _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_ is used instead.

> NOTE The representation of load-bearing beams in a structural analysis model is provided by subtypes of _IfcStructuralMember_ (with _IfcStructuralCurveMember_ being mostly applicable) as part of an _IfcStructuralAnalysisModel_. The camber of a beam may be defined by assigning an _IfcStructuralCurveMember_ with displacement coordinates. Multiple sets of camber ordinates may be provided that are qualified by the particular load case, where full dead load would typically be used for fabrication, and other scenarios used for other loading conditions such as during construction.

> HISTORY New entity in IFC1.0

## Attributes

### PredefinedType
Predefined generic type for a beam that is specified in an enumeration. There may be a property set given specifically for the predefined types.
> NOTE The _PredefinedType_ shall only be used, if no _IfcBeamType_ is assigned, providing its own _IfcBeamType.PredefinedType_.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE The attribute has been added at the end of the entity definition.

## Formal Propositions

### CorrectPredefinedType
Either the _PredefinedType_ attribute is unset (e.g. because an _IfcBeamType_ is associated), or the inherited attribute _ObjectType_ shall be provided, if the _PredefinedType_ is set to USERDEFINED.

### CorrectTypeAssigned
Either there is no beam type object associated, i.e. the _IsTypedBy_ inverse relationship is not provided, or the associated type object has to be of type _IfcBeamType_.

## Concepts

### Axis 3D Geometry

The axis representation can be used to represent the fundamental orientation and extents of a beams's body.

If an _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_ is used, the axis representation is used to locate the profile. In addition:

 * For a body representation using an _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_, the axis may be an _IfcPolyline_ having two Points, or _IfcTrimmedCurve_ with BasisCurve of type _IfcLine_. The axis curve lies on the z axis of the object coordinate system.
 * For a body representation using an _IfcRevolvedAreaSolid_, the axis may be an _IfcTrimmedCurve_ with BasisCurve of type _IfcCircle_. The axis curve lies on the x/z plane of the object coordinate system, the tangent at the start is along the positive z-axis.

As shown in Figure 76, the axis shall be defined along the z axis of the object coordinate system.

![Axis](../../../../figures/ifcbeamstandardcase_axis-01.png)

Figure 76 — Beam axis representation

As shown in Figure 77, the axis representation must be positioned at the _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_._CardinalPoint_, and parallel to the _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_._ExtrudedDirection_. This offset between the axis line and the _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_._Position_ must correlate with the chosen _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_._CardinalPoint_.

![Axis](../../../../figures/ifcbeamstandardcase_axis-02.png)

Figure 77 — Beam axis cardinal point

#### Axis_IfcBoundedCurve_Curve3D

Three-dimensional reference curve for the beam.

### Body AdvancedSweptSolid Geometry

* _IfcSurfaceCurveSweptAreaSolid_, _IfcFixedReferenceSweptAreaSolid_, _IfcExtrudedAreaSolidTapered_, _IfcRevolvedAreaSolidTapered_ shall be supported.
* All subtypes of _IfcProfileDef_ (with exception of _IfcArbitraryOpenProfileDef_)

### Body Clipping Geometry

* _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_, _IfcRevolvedAreaSolid_ shall be supported
* All subtypes of _IfcProfileDef_ (with exception of _IfcArbitraryOpenProfileDef_)
* All extrusion directions shall be supported.
* The _IfcBooleanClippingResult_ shall be supported, allowing for Boolean differences between the swept solid (here _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_) and one or several _IfcHalfSpaceSolid_ (or its subtypes).

Figure 201 illustrates use of _IfcBooleanClippingResult_ between an _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_ and an _IfcHalfSpaceSolid_ to create a clipped body.

![clipped beam](../../../../figures/ifcbeam_advanced-2-layout1.gif)
Figure 201 — Beam clipping

### Body SweptSolid Geometry

 * _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_, _IfcRevolvedAreaSolid_ shall be supported
 * All subtypes of _IfcProfileDef_
 * All extrusion directions shall be supported.

When an _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_ is assigned to the _IfcBeam_:

 * For all single profiles, the _IfcParameterizedProfileDef_._Position_ shall be NIL, or having _Location_ = 0.,0. and _RefDirection_ = 1.,0.
 * The extrusion shall be perpendicular to the profile direction.
 * Orientation: The y-axis of the profile, as determined by _IfcSweptAreaSolid_._Position_._P[2]_ shall point upwards. It indicates the "role" of the beam, a role=0° means y-axis of profile pointing upwards.

Figure 200 illustrates the 'SweptSolid' geometric representation. There are no restrictions or conventions on how to use the local placement (black), solid of extrusion placement (red) and profile placement (green).

![non-perpendicular extrusion](../../../../figures/ifcbeam_advanced-1-layout1.gif)

Figure 201 — Beam non-perpendicular extrusion

If parametric profiles are used, the parameters may be interpreted to be the dimensions of the beam:

* _IfcRectangleProfileDef_._YDim_ interpreted as beam height
* _IfcRectangleProfileDef_._XDim_ interpreted as beam width
* _IfcCircleProfileDef_._Radius_ interpreted as beam radius.

The inherited attribute _ElementType_ shall be provided, if the _PredefinedType_ is set to USERDEFINED.

## Concepts

### Material Profile Set

The material of the _IfcBeamType_ is defined by the _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ or as fall back by _IfcMaterial_ and attached by the _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_._RelatingMaterial_. It is accessible by the inverse _HasAssociations_ relationship.

The shared profile definition is defined by assigning an _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ (see material use definition above). The _IfcMaterialProfile_ refers to the subtype of _IfcProfileDef_ that is the common profile for all beam occurrence, if used. If an _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ is used, all occurrences must have a corresponding _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_.

> NOTE  The attribute _ProfileName_ of the _IfcProfileDef_ subtype, referenced in _IfcMaterialProfile_ should contain a standardized profile name according to local standards. However, an additional geometric representation of the profile is necessary (such as _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_). An importing application is allowed to check for the existence of the profile name: in case of identifying it as a standardized name, the corresponding profile geometry and possibly other cross sectional properties can be read from a library. Otherwise the geometric representation and possible non geometric _IfcProfileProperties_ have to be used.

### Type Body Geometry

The _IfcBeamType_ may define the shared geometric representation for all beam occurrences. The _RepresentationMaps_ attribute refers to a list of _IfcRepresentationMap_'s, that allow for multiple geometric representations (e.g. with _IfcShapeRepresentation_'s having an _RepresentationIdentifier_ 'Box', 'Axis', or 'Body'). It is only applicable if the _IfcBeamType_ has only occurrences of type _IfcBeam_ (See geometric use definition of _IfcBeam_ for further information).

> NOTE If the _IfcBeamType_ has an associated _IfcMaterialProfileSet_, then no shared geometric representation shall be provided.

> NOTE The product shape representations are defined as _RepresentationMaps_ (attribute of the supertype _IfcTypeProduct_), which get assigned by an element occurrence instance through the _IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[n]_ being an _IfcMappedItem_. See _IfcTypeProduct_ for further information.

> NOTE The values of attributes _RepresentationIdentifier_ and _RepresentationType_ of _IfcShapeRepresentation_ are restricted in the same way as those for _IfcBeam_

## Formal Propositions

### HasObjectName
A _Name_ attribute should be asserted for a building element proxy.

### CorrectPredefinedType
Either the _PredefinedType_ attribute is unset (e.g. because an _IfcBuildingElementProxyType_ is associated), or the inherited attribute _ObjectType_ shall be provided, if the _PredefinedType_ is set to USERDEFINED.

### CorrectTypeAssigned
Either there is no building element proxy type object associated, i.e. the _IsTypedBy_ inverse relationship is not provided, or the associated type object has to be of type _IfcBuildingElementProxyType_.

## Concepts

### Object Typing

> NOTE The _IfcBuildingElementProxyType_ can be used to share common information among many occurrences of the same proxy without establishing a particular semantic meaning of the type.

If no _IfcBuildingElementProxyType_ is attached (i.e. if only occurrence information is available) the _PredefinedType_ should be provided. If set to USERDEFINED a user defined value has to be provided by the _ObjectType_ attribute.

CATEGORY: schemas
----------------------------------

# IfcColumn

An _IfcColumn_ is a vertical structural or architectural member which often is aligned with a structural grid intersection. In most cases it represents a vertical, or nearly vertical, structural member that transmits, through compression, the weight of the structure above to other structural elements below. It may also represent such a member from an architectural point of view in which case it may represent a non load bearing element.
<!-- end of short definition -->

 Whether it is a structural load bearing element or a non-load bearing element is determined by the _Pset\_ColumnCommon.LoadBearing_ property.


There are two main representations for column occurrences:

 * _IfcColumn_ with _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_ is used for all occurrences of columns, that have a profile defined that is swept along a directrix. The profile might change uniformly by a taper definition along the directrix. The profile parameter and its cardinal point of insertion can be fully described by the _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_. These columns are always represented geometricly by an 'Axis' and a 'SweptSolid' or 'AdvancedSweptSolid' shape representation (or by a 'Clipping' geometry based on the swept solid), if a 3D geometric representation is assigned.
 * _IfcColumn_ is used for all other occurrences of columns, particularly for columns with changing profile sizes along the extrusion, or columns defined by non-linear extrusion, or columns having only 'Brep', or 'SurfaceModel' geometry, if a more parametric representation is not intended.


For any longitudial structural member, not constrained to be predominately horizontal nor vertical, or where this semantic information is irrelevant, the entity _IfcMember_ exists.

## Concepts

### Axis 3D Geometry

The axis representation can be used to represent the fundamental orientation and extents of a column's body.

If an _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_ is used, the axis representation is used to locate the profile. In addition:

 * For a body representation using an _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_, the axis may be an _IfcPolyline_ having two Points, or _IfcTrimmedCurve_ with _BasisCurve_ of type _IfcLine_. The axis curve lies on the z axis of the object coordinate system.
 * For a body representation using an _IfcRevolvedAreaSolid_, the axis may be an _IfcTrimmedCurve_ with _BasisCurve_ of type _IfcCircle_. The axis curve lies on the x/z plane of the object coordinate system, the tangent at the start is along the positive z-axis.

As shown in Figure COLAXREP, the axis shall be defined along the z axis of the object coordinate system.

![Axis](../../../../figures/ifccolumnstandardcase_axis-01.png)

Figure COLAXREP — Column axis representation

As shown in Figure CALAXCARPOINT, the axis representation must be positioned at the _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_._CardinalPoint_, and parallel to the _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_._ExtrudedDirection_. This offset between the axis line and the _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_._Position_ must correlate with the chosen _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_._CardinalPoint_.

* _IfcSurfaceCurveSweptAreaSolid_, _IfcFixedReferenceSweptAreaSolid_, _IfcExtrudedAreaSolidTapered_, _IfcRevolvedAreaSolidTapered_ shall be supported.
* All subtypes of _IfcProfileDef_ (with exception of _IfcArbitraryOpenProfileDef_) shall be supported

### Material Profile Set

The material of the _IfcColumnType_ is defined by the _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ or as fall back by _IfcMaterial_ and attached by the _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_._RelatingMaterial_. It is accessible by the inverse _HasAssociations_ relationship.

The shared profile definition is defined by assigning an _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ (see material use definition above). The _IfcMaterialProfile_ refers to the subtype of _IfcProfileDef_ that is the common profile for all column occurrence, if used. If an _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ is used, all occurrences of _IfcColumn_ must have a corresponding _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_.

> NOTE  The attribute _ProfileName_ of the _IfcProfileDef_ subtype, referenced in _IfcMaterialProfile_ should contain a standardized profile name according to local standards. However, an additional geometric representation of the profile is necessary (e.g. as _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_). An importing application is allowed to check for the existence of the profile name: in case of identifying it as a standardized name, the corresponding profile geometry and possibly other cross sectional properties can be read from a library. Otherwise the geometric representation and possible non geometric _IfcProfileProperties_ have to be used.

### Type Body Geometry

The _IfcColumnType_ may define the shared geometric representation for all column occurrences. The _RepresentationMaps_ attribute refers to a list of _IfcRepresentationMap_'s, that allow for multiple geometric representations (e.g. with _IfcShapeRepresentation_'s having an _RepresentationIdentifier_ 'Box', 'Axis', or 'Body'). It is only applicable if the _IfcColumnType_ has only occurrences of type _IfcColumn_ (See geometric use definition of _IfcColumn_ for further information).

> NOTE If the _IfcColumnType_ has an associated _IfcMaterialProfileSet_, then no shared geometric representation shall be provided.

> NOTE The product shape representations are defined as _RepresentationMaps_ (attribute of the supertype _IfcTypeProduct_), which get assigned by an element occurrence instance through the _IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[n]_ being an _IfcMappedItem_. See _IfcTypeProduct_ for further information.

{ .extDef}
> NOTE Definition according to ISO ISO 6707-1: final coverings and treatments of surfaces and their intersections.

Coverings are elements with relationships to the covered element and the space on the other side, they may contain openings, assigned by _IfcRelVoidsElement_, material information, assigned by _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_, and others.

> EXAMPLE Coverings include wall claddings, floorings, suspended ceilings, moldings and skirting boards.

> NOTE A more basic information about claddings, floorings, and ceilings of a space can be attached to _IfcSpace_'s using the _Pset_SpaceCommon_ properties. Then only a name can be provided and the covering quantities would be interpreted from the space quantities.

Coverings can be assigned to

* a space represented by _IfcSpace_
  * using the inverse relationship _CoversSpaces_ pointing to _IfcRelCoversSpaces_. The space is then accessible via _IfcRelCoversSpaces.RelatedSpace_. It defines to which space a covering is facing towards.
* a space boundary represented by _IfcRelSpaceBoundary_
  * using the inverse relationship _ProvidesBoundaries_ pointing to _IfcRelSpaceBoundary._ The space is then accessible via _IfcRelSpaceBoundary.RelatingSpace_.
* a built element represented by _IfcBuiltElement_
  * using the inverse relationship _Covers_ pointing to _IfcRelCoversBldgElements_. The building element is then accessible via _IfcRelCoversBldgElements.RelatingBuildingElement_.

> NOTE The mere containment relationship between an _IfcCovering_ and an _IfcSpace_ is created by using _IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure_

The following guideline shall apply:

* (default) if the space has coverings that may not have their own shape representation and no defined relationships to the building elements they cover, then the _IfcCovering_ shall be assigned to _IfcSpace_ using the _IfcRelCoversSpaces_ relationship,
* if the space has coverings that have an own shape representation and the space has defined space boundaries, then the covering, which relates to that space, shall be contained in the space using _IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure_. It may be assigned to the space boundaries using the _IfcRelSpaceBoundary_.
* if the covering does not relate to a space, then the covering should be assigned to the building element or a distribution element using the _IfcRelCoversBldgElements_ relationship.

A curtain wall is a wall of a building which is an assembly of components, hung from the edge of the floor/roof structure rather than bearing on a floor. Curtain wall is represented as a building element assembly and implemented as a subtype of _IfcBuiltElement_ that uses an _IfcRelAggregates_ relationship. A curtain wall is often external, but using _Pset_CurtainWallCommon.IsExternal_ can be used to define interior curtain walls.

The geometric representation of _IfcCurtainWall_ is given by the _IfcProductDefinitionShape_, allowing multiple geometric representations. Independent 'Body' geometric representation, as described below, should only be used when the _IfcCurtainWall_ is not defined as an aggregate. If defined as an aggregate, the geometric representation is the sum of the representations of the components within the aggregate.

The geometric representation of _IfcCurtainWall_ is defined using the following multiple shape representations for its definition:

* Axis: A two-dimensional open curve (for restrictions see below) defining the axis for the curtain wall.
  * This is an optional representation for curtain walls.

# IfcDoor

The door is a built element that is predominately used to provide controlled access for people, goods, animals and vehicles. It includes constructions with hinged, pivoted, sliding, and additionally revolving and folding operations. A door can:

* be a "free standing" door, contained in an _IfcSpatialElement_ such as an _IfcBuildingStorey_.
* fill an opening, typically in a wall. The door will then have a _FillsVoids_ attribute which uses the _IfcRelFillsElement_ relationship to relate the _IfcDoor_ with the _IfcOpeningElement_;
* be part of an element assembly, typically an _IfcCurtainWall_. The door will then have a _Decomposes_ attribute which uses the the _IfcRelAggregates_ relationship to relate the door with the assembly of elements;
<!-- end of short definition -->

There are two main representations for door occurrences:

 * _IfcDoor_ entities that have a 3D rectangle 'Profile' shape representation defined. This profile can then be used to parametrically generate the geometry of a door. If not provided, the profile of the _IfcOpeningElement_ can be used if the door fills an opening. The parameters are specified on the relating _IfcDoorType_ that references _IfcDoorLiningProperties_ and _IfcDoorPanelProperties_ for each panel in the door;
 * _IfcDoor_ entities that are not parametrically generated and have only 'Brep', or 'SurfaceModel' geometry.

In addition, an _IfcDoor_ may commonly include a 'FootPrint' representation defining the 2D shape of the door and its swing.

The parameters of a door are defined by both the _IfcDoor_ occurrence and its _IfcDoorType_. The _IfcDoor_ specifies:

 * the door width and height
 * the door opening direction (by the positive y-axis of the _ObjectPlacement_)

The _IfcDoorType_ specifies parameters which are common to all of its occurrences of _IfcDoor_:

 * the operation type (single swing, double swing, revolving, etc.)
 * the door hinge side (by using two different styles for right and left opening doors)
 * the particular attributes for the lining by the _IfcDoorLiningProperties_
 * the particular attributes for the panels by the _IfcDoorPanelProperties_

> REFERENCE Definition according to ISO 6707-1: construction for closing an opening, intended primarily for access with hinged, pivoted or sliding operation.

## Attributes

### OverallHeight
Overall measure of the height, it reflects the Z Dimension of a bounding box, enclosing the body of the door opening. If omitted, the _OverallHeight_ should be taken from the geometric representation of the _IfcOpeningElement_ in which the door is inserted.

> NOTE The body of the door might be taller then the door opening (e.g. in cases where the door lining includes a casing). In these cases the _OverallHeight_ shall still be given as the door opening height, and not as the total height of the door lining.

### OverallWidth
Overall measure of the width, it reflects the X Dimension of a bounding box, enclosing the body of the door opening. If omitted, the _OverallWidth_ should be taken from the geometric representation of the _IfcOpeningElement_ in which the door is inserted.

> NOTE The body of the door might be wider then the door opening (e.g. in cases where the door lining includes a casing). In these cases the _OverallWidth_ shall still be given as the door opening width, and not as the total width of the door lining.

### PredefinedType


### OperationType
Type defining the general layout and operation of the door type in terms of the partitioning of panels and panel operations.

> NOTE The _OperationType_ shall only be used, if no type object _IfcDoorType_ is assigned, providing its own _IfcDoorType.OperationType_.

### UserDefinedOperationType
Designator for the user defined operation type, shall only be provided, if the value of _OperationType_ is set to USERDEFINED.

## Formal Propositions

### CorrectStyleAssigned
Either there is no door type object associated, i.e. the _IsTypedBy_ inverse relationship is not provided, or the associated type object has to be of type _IfcDoorType_.

### CorrectPredefinedType

### CorrectTypeAssigned
Either there is no door type object associated, i.e. the _IsTypedBy_ inverse relationship is not provided, or the associated type object has to be of type _IfcDoorType_.

## Concepts

### Door Attributes

The opening direction is determined by the local placement of _IfcDoor_ and the _OperationType_ of the _IfcDoorType_.

The _IfcDoorTypeOperationEnum_ defines the general layout of the door type and its symbolic presentation. Depending on the enumerator, the appropriate instances of _IfcDoorLiningProperties_ and _IfcDoorPanelProperties_ are attached in the list of _HasPropertySets_. The _IfcDoorTypeOperationEnum_ mainly determines the hinge side (left hung, or right hung), the operation (swinging, sliding, folding, etc.) and the number of panels.

There are different definitions in various countries on what a left opening or left hung or left swing door is (same for right). Therefore the IFC definition may deviate from the local standard and needs to be mapped appropriately. Example mappings are shown in Table 228, where it assumes that the 'inside/private/primary' space is above (top in the pictures) and the 'outside/public/secondary' space is below (bottom in the pictures).

| Opening | Definitions | US Mapping | German Mapping |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ![fig 1](../../../../figures/ifcdoor-fig01.gif) | The door panel (for swinging doors) opens always into the direction of the positive Y axis of the local placement. The determination of whether the door opens to the left or to the right is done at the level of the _IfcDoorType_. Here it is a left side opening door given by _IfcDoorType.OperationType_ = SingleSwingLeft | LEFT HAND (LH) | DIN-R (right hung) |
| ![fig 2](../../../../figures/ifcdoor-fig02.gif) | If the door should open to the other side, then the local placement has to be changed. It is still a left side opening door, given by _IfcDoorType_._OperationType_ = SingleSwingLeft | RIGHT HAND REVERSE (RHR) | DIN-R (right hung) |
| ![fig 3](../../../../figures/ifcdoor-fig03.gif) | If the door panel (for swinging doors) opens to the right, a separate door style needs to be used (here _IfcDoorType_._OperationType_ = SingleSwingRight) and it always opens into the direction of the positive Y axis of the local placement. | RIGHT HAND (RH) | DIN-L (left hung) |
| ![fig 4](../../../../figures/ifcdoor-fig04.gif) | If the door panel (for swinging doors) opens to the right, and into the opposite direction, the local placement of the door needs to change. The door style is given by _IfcDoorType_._OperationType_ = SingleSwingRight. | LEFT HAND REVERSE (LHR) | DIN-L (left hung) |

### Material Set

#### Lining

#### Framing

Indicates that the material constituent applies to the door panel(s); if not provided, the 'Lining' material information applies to panel(s) as well.

#### Glazing

Indicates that the material constituent applies to the glazing part.

### Product Local Placement

The following restriction is imposed:

1. The _PlacementRelTo_ relationship of _IfcLocalPlacement_ shall point to the local placement of the same element (if given), in which the _IfcDoor_ is used as a filling (normally an _IfcOpeningElement_), as provided by the _IfcRelFillsElement_ relationship;
2. If the _IfcDoor_ is part of an assembly, e.g. an _IfcCurtainWall_, then the _PlacementRelTo_ relationship of _IfcLocalPlacement_ shall point (if given) to the local placement of that assembly;
3. If the _IfcDoor_ is not inserted into an _IfcOpeningElement_, then the _PlacementRelTo_ relationship of _IfcLocalPlacement_ shall point (if given) to the local placement of the same _IfcSpatialStructureElement_ that is used in the _ContainedInStructure_ inverse attribute or to a referenced spatial structure element at a higher level.

> NOTE The product placement is used to determine the opening direction of the door.

### Profile 3D Geometry

The door profile is represented by a three-dimensional closed curve lying in the xz plane. The profile is used to apply the parameters of a parametric door representation. The following attribute values for the _IfcShapeRepresentation_ holding this geometric representation shall be used:

* _RepresentationIdentifier_: 'Profile'
* _RepresentationType_: 'Curve3D' or 'GeometricCurveSet'. In case of 'GeometricCurveSet' only a single closed curve shall be contained in the set of _IfcShapeRepresentation.Items_.

The following additional constraints apply to the 'Profile' representation type:

* Curve: being an _IfcPolyline_ defining a rectangle.
* Position: The curve shall lie in the xz plane of the object placement coordinate (the y coordinate values of the _IfcCartesianPoint_'s shall be 0.).

Figure 229 illustrates applying the door lining parameters to the door profile shape representation. The profile defines the outer boundary to which the door lining parameters relate as:

* _IfcDoorLiningProperties.LiningDepth_ starting at distance defined by _LiningOffset_ going into the positive y direction.
* _IfcDoorLiningProperties.LiningThickness_ offset into the inner side of the rectangle.
* _IfcDoorLiningProperties.LiningOffset_ distance along the positive y direction to where the _LiningDepth_ applies.
* _IfcDoorLiningProperties.ThresholdThickness_ starting at the bottom edge of the rectangle into the inner side of the rectangle
* _IfcDoorLiningProperties.ThresholdDepth_ starting at distance defined by _LiningOffset_ going into the positive y direction.
* _IfcDoorLiningProperties.TransomOffset_ starting at the bottom edge of the rectangle (along local x axis) into the inner side of the rectangle, distance provided as percentage of overall height. Distance to the centre line of the transom.

# IfcMember

An _IfcMember_ is a structural member designed to carry loads between or beyond points of support. It is not required to be load bearing. The orientation of the member (being horizontal, vertical or sloped) is not relevant to its definition (in contrary to _IfcBeam_ and _IfcColumn_). An _IfcMember_ represents a linear structural element from an architectural or structural modeling point of view and shall be used if it cannot be expressed more specifically as either an _IfcBeam_ or an _IfcColumn_.
<!-- end of short definition -->

There are two main representations for member occurrences:

 * _IfcMember_ with _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_ is used for all occurrences of members, that have a profile defined that is swept along a directrix. The profile might be changed uniformly by a taper definition along the directrix. The profile parameter and its cardinal point of insertion can be fully described by the _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_. These members are always represented geometricly by an 'Axis' and a 'SweptSolid' or 'AdvancedSweptSolid' shape representation (or by a 'Clipping' geometry based on the swept solid), if a 3D geometric representation is assigned.
 * _IfcMember_ without _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_ is used for all other occurrences of members, particularly for members with changing profile sizes along the extrusion, or members defined by non-linear extrusion, or members having only 'Brep', or 'SurfaceModel' geometry, or if a more parametric representation is not intended.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE The attribute has been added at the end of the entity definition.

## Formal Propositions

### CorrectPredefinedType
Either the _PredefinedType_ attribute is unset (e.g. because an _IfcMemberType_ is associated), or the inherited attribute _ObjectType_ shall be provided, if the _PredefinedType_ is set to USERDEFINED.

### CorrectTypeAssigned
Either there is no member type object associated, i.e. the _IsTypedBy_ inverse relationship is not provided, or the associated type object has to be of type _IfcMemberType_.

## Concepts

### Axis 3D Geometry

The axis representation can be used to represent the fundamental orientation and extents of a member's body.

If an _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_ is used, the axis representation is used to locate the profile. In addition:

 * For a body representation using an _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_, the axis may be an _IfcPolyline_ having two Points, or _IfcTrimmedCurve_ with BasisCurve of type _IfcLine_. The axis curve lies on the z axis of the object coordinate system.
 * For a body representation using an _IfcRevolvedAreaSolid_, the axis may be an _IfcTrimmedCurve_ with BasisCurve of type _IfcCircle_. The axis curve lies on the x/z plane of the object coordinate system, the tangent at the start is along the positive z-axis.

As shown in Figure 235, the axis representation can be used to represent the system length of a member that may extend past the body length of the member.

![Axis](../../../../figures/ifcmemberstandardcase_axis-01.png)

Figure 235 — Member axis representation

As shown in Figure 236, the axis representation must be positioned at the _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_._CardinalPoint_, and parallel to the _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_._ExtrudedDirection_. This offset between the axis line and the _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_._Position_ must correlate with the chosen _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_.CardinalPoint.

#### Axis_IfcBoundedCurve_Curve3D

Three-dimensional reference curve for the member.

### Body AdvancedSweptSolid Geometry

* _IfcSurfaceCurveSweptAreaSolid_, _IfcFixedReferenceSweptAreaSolid_, _IfcExtrudedAreaSolidTapered_, _IfcRevolvedAreaSolidTapered_ shall be supported.
* All subtypes of _IfcProfileDef_ (with exception of _IfcArbitraryOpenProfileDef_) shall be supported

### Body Clipping Geometry

* _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_, _IfcRevolvedAreaSolid_ shall be supported
* All subtypes of _IfcProfileDef_ (with exception of _IfcArbitraryOpenProfileDef_) shall be supported
* All extrusion directions shall be supported.
* The _IfcBooleanClippingResult_ shall be supported, allowing for Boolean differences between the swept solid (here _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_) and one or several _IfcHalfSpaceSolid_ (or its subtypes).

Figure 238 illustrates a 'Clipping' geometric representation with use of _IfcBooleanClippingResult_ between an _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_ and an _IfcHalfSpaceSolid_ to create a clipped body.

![clipped member](../../../../figures/ifcmember_clipping-01.png)

Figure 238 — Member clipping

When an _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_ is applied, Figure 239 illustrates an advanced geometric representation with use of _IfcBooleanClippingResult_ between an _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_ and an _IfcHalfSpaceSolid_ to create a clipped body, with cardinal point applied as 4 (mid-depth left).

### Body SweptSolid Geometry

* _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_, _IfcRevolvedAreaSolid_ shall be supported
* All subtypes of _IfcProfileDef_ (with exception of _IfcArbitraryOpenProfileDef_) shall be supported
* All extrusion directions shall be supported.

When an _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_ is assigned to the _IfcMember_:

* For all single profiles, the _IfcParameterizedProfileDef.Position_ shall be NIL, or having _Location_ = 0.,0. and _RefDirection_ = 1.,0.
* The extrusion shall be perpendicular to the profile direction.
* The y-axis of the profile, as determined by _IfcSweptAreaSolid.Position.P[2]_ shall point to the Z-Axis. It indicates the "role" of the column, a role=0° means y-axis of profile = Z-axis of reference coordinate system. In the exception of a vertical member, the y-axis shall point to the Y-axis.

Figure 236 illustrates a 'SweptSolid' geometric representation with cardinal point applied as 1 (bottom left).

If parametric profiles are used, the parameters may be interpreted to be the dimensions of the beam:

* _IfcRectangleProfileDef.YDim_ interpreted as member width
* _IfcRectangleProfileDef.XDim_ interpreted as member depth
* _IfcCircleProfileDef.Radius_ interpreted as member radius.

# IfcMemberType

The element type _IfcMemberType_ defines commonly shared information for occurrences of members. Members are predominately linear building elements, often forming part of a structural system. The orientation of the member (being horizontal, vertical or sloped) is not relevant to its definition (in contrary to beam and column). The set of shared information may include:

* common properties within shared property sets
* common material information
* common profile definitions
* common shape representations
<!-- end of short definition -->

It is used to define a member specification, or member style (the specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that member type). Member types may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.

Occurrences of the _IfcMemberType_ within building models are represented by instances of _IfcMember_. Occurrences of the _IfcMemberType_ within structural analysis models are represented by instances of _IfcStructuralCurveMember_, or its applicable subtypes.

> HISTORY New entity in IFC2x2 Addendum 1.

## Attributes

### PredefinedType
Identifies the predefined types of a linear structural member element from which the type required may be set.

## Formal Propositions

### CorrectPredefinedType
The inherited attribute _ElementType_ shall be provided, if the _PredefinedType_ is set to USERDEFINED.

## Concepts

### Material Profile Set
The material of the _IfcMemberType_ is defined by the
_IfcMaterialProfileSet_ or as fall back by
_IfcMaterial_ and attached by the
_IfcRelAssociatesMaterial.RelatingMaterial_. It is
accessible by the inverse _HasAssociations_
relationship.

The shared profile definition is defined by assigning an
_IfcMaterialProfileSet_ (see material use definition above).
The _IfcMaterialProfile_ refers to the subtype of
_IfcProfileDef_ that is the common profile for all member
occurrence, if used. If an _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ is used, all occurrences must have a corresponding _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_.

> NOTE  The attribute _ProfileName_ of the

> identifying it as a standardized name, the corresponding profile
> geometry and possibly other cross sectional properties can be
> read from a library. Otherwise the geometric representation and
> possible non geometric _IfcProfileProperties_ have to be
> used.

### Type Body Geometry

The _IfcMemberType_ may define the shared geometric representation for all member occurrences. The _RepresentationMaps_ attribute refers to a list of _IfcRepresentationMap_'s, that allow for multiple geometric representations (e.g. with _IfcShapeRepresentation_'s having an _RepresentationIdentifier_ 'Box', 'Axis', or 'Body'). It is only applicable if the _IfcMemberType_ has only occurrences of type _IfcMember_ (See geometric use definition of _IfcMember_ for further information).

> NOTE If the _IfcMemberType_ has an associated _IfcMaterialProfileSet_, then no shared geometric representation shall be provided.

> NOTE The product shape representations are defined as _RepresentationMaps_ (attribute of the supertype _IfcTypeProduct_), which get assigned by an element occurrence instance through the _IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[n]_ being an _IfcMappedItem_. See _IfcTypeProduct_ for further information.

> NOTE The values of attributes _RepresentationIdentifier_ and _RepresentationType_ of _IfcShapeRepresentation_ are restricted in the same way as those for _IfcMember_

# IfcPlate

An _IfcPlate_ is a planar and often flat part with constant thickness. A plate may carry loads between or beyond points of support, or provide stiffening. The location of the plate (being horizontal, vertical or sloped) is not relevant to its definition.
<!-- end of short definition -->

Plates are normally made of steel, other metallic material, or by glass panels. However the definition of _IfcPlate_ is material independent and specific material information shall be handled by using _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_ to assign a material specification to the _IfcPlate_.

Plates are often add-on parts. This is represented by the _IfcRelAggregates_ decomposition mechanism used to aggregate parts, such as _IfcPlate_, into a container element such as _IfcElementAssembly_ or _IfcCurtainWall_.

An instance of _IfcPlate_ should preferably get its geometric representation and material assignment through the type definition by _IfcPlateType_ assigned using the _IfcRelDefinesByType_ relationship. This allows identical plates in a construction to be represented by the same instance of _IfcPlateType_.

A plate may have openings, such as voids or recesses. They are defined by an _IfcOpeningElement_ attached to the plate using the inverse relationship _HasOpenings_ pointing to _IfcRelVoidsElement_. The position number of a plate as often used in steel construction is assigned through the attribute _IfcElement.Tag_

There are two main representations for plate occurrences:

 * _IfcPlate_ with _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ is used for all occurrences of plates, that are prismatic and where the thickness parameter can be fully described by the _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_. These plates are always represented geometrically by a 'SweptSolid' geometry (or by a 'Clipping' geometry based on 'SweptSolid'), if a 3D geometric representation is assigned.
 * _IfcPlate_ without _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ is used for all other occurrences of plates, particularly for plates with changing thickness, or plates with non planar surfaces, and plates having only 'SurfaceModel' or 'Brep' geometry or if a more parametric representation is not intended.

> REFERENCE Definition according to ISO 6707-1: thin, rigid, flat, metal product, of a thickness greater than that of a sheet.

Either the _PredefinedType_ attribute is unset (e.g. because an _IfcPlateType_ is associated), or the inherited attribute _ObjectType_ shall be provided, if the _PredefinedType_ is set to USERDEFINED.

### CorrectTypeAssigned
Either there is no plate type object associated, i.e. the _IsTypedBy_ inverse relationship is not provided, or the associated type object has to be of type _IfcPlateType_.

## Concepts

### Body Clipping Geometry

* _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_ is required,
* _IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef_, _IfcArbitraryProfileDefWithVoids_, _IfcRectangleProfileDef_, _IfcCircleProfileDef_, _IfcEllipseProfileDef_ shall be supported.
* The profile can be extruded perpendicularly or non-perpendicularly to the plane of the swept profile.
* The definition of the _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_, particularly of the _OffsetFromReferenceLine_ and the _ForLayerSet.TotalThickness_, has to be consistent to the 'SweptSolid' representation.
* The _IfcBooleanClippingResult_ shall be supported, allowing for Boolean differences between the swept solid (here _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_) and one or several _IfcHalfSpaceSolid_.

Figure 248 illustrates a 'Clipping' geometric representation with definition of a plate using advanced geometric representation. The profile is extruded non-perpendicular and the plate body is clipped at the eave.

![advanced plate](../../../../figures/ifcslab_advanced-layout1.gif)

Figure 248 — Plate body clipping

### Body SweptSolid Geometry

* _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_ is required,
* _IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef_, _IfcArbitraryProfileDefWithVoids_, _IfcRectangleProfileDef_, _IfcCircleProfileDef_, _IfcEllipseProfileDef_ shall be supported.
* The profile can be extruded perpendicularly or non-perpendicularly to the plane of the swept profile.

Figure 247 illustrates a 'SweptSolid' geometric representation. The following interpretation of dimension parameter applies for polygonal plates (in ground floor view): _IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef.OuterCurve_ being a closed bounded curve is interpreted as area (or foot print) of the plate.

### Material Layer Set Usage

Figure 277 illustrates assignment of _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ and _IfcMaterialLayerSet_ to the _IfcPlateType_ and the _IfcPlate_ occurrence.

![Material layer set and usage](../../../../figures/ifcplate_materialusage-01.png) 

Figure 277 — Plate type definition

Figure 247 illustrates material layer usage, where:

* The reference coordinate system is the coordinate system established by the _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid.Position_.
* The reference plane is the plane defined by the extruded profile of _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid.SweptSolid_. The _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage.OffsetFromReferenceLine_ is given as a distance from this plane.
* The _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage.DirectionSense_ defines how the _IfcMaterialLayer_'s are assigned to the reference plane. POSITIVE means in direction to the positive z-axis of the reference coordinate system.
* The _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage.OffsetFromReferenceLine_ is the distance parallel to the reference plane and always perpendicular to the base (XY) plane of the reference coordinate system. This is independent of a potential non-perpendicular extrusion given by _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid.ExtrudedDirection_ <> 0.,0.,1. A positive value of _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage.OffsetFromReferenceLine_ would then point into the positive z-axis of the reference coordinate system.
* The _Thickness_ of each _IfcMaterialLayer_ shall be the parallel distance (measured perpendicular to the base plane). The _TotalThickness_ of the _IfcMaterialLayerSet_ is the sum of all layer thicknesses and in case of a perpendicular extrusion identical with _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid.Depth_
* The _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage.LayerSetDirection_ is always AXIS3.
* The local placement of the wall uses the the x/y plane for the profile, and the z-axis as the extrusion direction for the wall body.

# IfcPlateType

The element type _IfcPlateType_ defines commonly shared information for occurrences of plates. The set of shared information may include:

* common properties within shared property sets
* common material information
* common material layer definitions
* common shape representations
<!-- end of short definition -->

It is used to define a plate specification (i.e. the specific product information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type). Plate types may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.

> NOTE The product representations are defined as representation maps (at the level of the supertype _IfcTypeProduct_, which gets assigned by an element occurrence instance through the _IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]_ being an _IfcMappedItem_.

The occurrences of the _IfcPlateType_ within building models are represented by instances of _IfcPlate_.

# IfcRoofType

The building element type _IfcRoofType_ defines commonly shared information for occurrences of roofs. The set of shared information may include:

* common properties with shared property sets
* common representations
* common materials
* common composition of elements

# IfcSlab

A slab is a component of the construction that may enclose a space vertically. The slab may provide the lower support (floor) or upper construction (roof slab) in any space in a building.
<!-- end of short definition -->

Only the core or constructional part of this construction is considered to be a slab. The upper finish (flooring, roofing) and the lower finish (ceiling, suspended ceiling) are considered to be coverings. A special type of slab is the landing, described as a floor section to which one or more stair flights or ramp flights connect.

A slab may have openings, such as floor openings, or recesses. They are defined by an _IfcOpeningElement_ attached to the slab using the inverse relationship _HasOpenings_ pointing to _IfcRelVoidsElement_. Slabs with openings that have already been modeled within the enclosing geometry may use the relationship _IfcRelConnectsElements_ to associate the _IfcSlab_ with embedded elements such as trap doors.

There are two main representations for slab occurrences:

- _IfcSlab_ with _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ is used for all occurrences of slabs, that are prismatic and where the thickness parameter can be fully described by the _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_. These slabs are always represented geometrically by a 'SweptSolid' geometry (or by a 'Clipping' geometry based on 'SweptSolid'), if a 3D geometric representation is assigned.

- _IfcSlab_ without _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ is used for all other occurrences of slabs, particularly for slabs with changing thickness, or slabs with non planar surfaces, and slabs having only 'SweptSolid' or 'Brep' geometry, or if a more parametric representation is not intended.

> REFERENCE Definition according to ISO 6707-1: thick, flat or shaped component, usually larger than 300 mm square, used to form a covering or projecting from a building.

> NOTE  An arbitrary planar element to which this semantic information is not applicable or irrelevant shall be modeled as _IfcPlate_.

> NOTE The entity _IfcSlabStandardCase_ has been deleted, _IfcSlab_ with _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ is used instead. The entity _IfcSlabElementedCase_ has been deleted, _IfcSlab_ with _IfcRelAggregates_ is used to describe occurrences of slabs which are aggregated from subordinate elements.

> NOTE There is a representation of slabs for structural analysis provided by a proper subtype of _IfcStructuralMember_ being part of the _IfcStructuralAnalysisModel_.

> HISTORY New entity in IFC2.0; it is a merger of the two previous entities _IfcFloor_, _IfcRoofSlab_, introduced in IFC1.0

## Attributes

### PredefinedType
Predefined generic type for a slab that is specified in an enumeration. There may be a property set given specifically for the predefined types.
> NOTE The _PredefinedType_ shall only be used, if no _IfcSlabType_ is assigned, providing its own _IfcSlabType.PredefinedType_.

{ .change-ifc2x}
> IFC2x CHANGE The attribute has been changed into an OPTIONAL attribute.

## Formal Propositions

### CorrectPredefinedType
Either the _PredefinedType_ attribute is unset (e.g. because an _IfcSlabType_ is associated), or the inherited attribute _ObjectType_ shall be provided, if the _PredefinedType_ is set to USERDEFINED.

### CorrectTypeAssigned
Either there is no slab type object associated, i.e. the _IsTypedBy_ inverse relationship is not provided, or the associated type object has to be of type _IfcSlabType_.

## Concepts

### Body Clipping Geometry

The following constraints apply to the 'Clipping' representation:

* Solid: _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_ is required,
* Profile: _IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef_, _IfcRectangleProfileDef_, _IfcCircleProfileDef_, _IfcEllipseProfileDef_ shall be supported.
* Extrusion: The profile can be extruded perpendicularly or non-perpendicularly to the plane of the swept profile.
* Boolean result: The _IfcBooleanClippingResult_ shall be supported, allowing for Boolean differences between the swept solid (here _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_) and one or several _IfcHalfSpaceSolid_.

Additional constraints apply when an _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ is used:

* Material: The definition of the _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_, particularly of the _OffsetFromReferenceLine_ and the _ForLayerSet.TotalThickness_, has to be consistent to the 'SweptSolid' representation.

Figure 266 illustrates a 'Clipping' geometric representation with definition of a roof slab using advanced
geometric representation. The profile is extruded non-perpendicular and the slab body is clipped at the eave.

![advanced slab](../../../../figures/ifcslab_advanced-layout1.gif)

Figure 266 — Slab body clipping

### Body SweptSolid Geometry

The following constraints apply to the 'SweptSolid'
representation:

* Solid: _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_ is required,
* Profile: _IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef_, _IfcRectangleProfileDef_, _IfcCircleProfileDef_, _IfcEllipseProfileDef_ shall be supported.
* Extrusion: The profile can be extruded perpendicularly or non-perpendicularly to the plane of the swept profile.

For polygonal slabs, the following interpretation of dimension parameter applies:

 * _IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef.OuterCurve_: closed bounded curve interpreted as area (or foot print) of the slab.

Additional constraints apply when an _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ is used:

* Material: The definition of the _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_, particularly of the _OffsetFromReferenceLine_ and the _ForLayerSet.TotalThickness_, has to be consistent to the 'SweptSolid' representation.

### Element Decomposition

A slab may be decomposed into parts such as for structural framing and covering panels or topping. For efficiency, each part may reuse geometry using the mapped geometry concept.

#### IfcBuildingElementPart

Parts for other elements

### Element Voiding

As shown in Figure ELEMENTVOID, openings within an aggregated slab are directly assigned to _IfcSlab_ using _IfcRelVoidsElement_ pointing to _IfcOpeningElement_ and apply to all aggregated parts. If individual parts have cutting and other voiding features, then the decomposed parts have a separate voiding relationship _IfcRelVoidsElement_ pointing to _IfcVoidingFeature_.

```

IfcSlab [pos="0,0!"];

IfcBuildingElementPart [pos="0,-140!"];

}
```

### Material Layer Set Usage

Figure 262 illustrates assignment of _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ and _IfcMaterialLayerSet_ to the _IfcSlabType_ and the _IfcSlab_ occurrence.

![Material layer set and usage](../../../../figures/ifcslab_materialusage-01.png)

Figure 262 — Slab type definition


Figure 263 and Figure 264 illustrates material layer usage, where:

* The reference coordinate system is the coordinate system established by the _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid.Position_.
* The reference plane is the plane defined by the extruded profile of _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid.SweptSolid_. The _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage.OffsetFromReferenceLine_ is given as a distance from this plane.
* The _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage.DirectionSense_ defines how the _IfcMaterialLayer_'s are assigned to the reference plane. POSITIVE means in direction to the positive z-axis of the reference coordinate system.
* The _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage.OffsetFromReferenceLine_ is the distance parallel to the reference plane and always perpendicular to the base (XY) plane of the reference coordinate system. This is independent of a potential non-perpendicular extrusion given by _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid.ExtrudedDirection_ <> 0.,0.,1. A positive value of _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage.OffsetFromReferenceLine_ would then point into the positive z-axis of the reference coordinate system.
* The _Thickness_ of each _IfcMaterialLayer_ shall be the parallel distance (measured perpendicular to the base plane). The _TotalThickness_ of the _IfcMaterialLayerSet_ is the sum of all layer thicknesses and in case of a perpendicular extrusion identical with _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid.Depth_
* The _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage.LayerSetDirection_ is always AXIS3.
* The local placement of the slab uses the the x/y plane for the profile, and the z-axis as the extrusion direction for the slab body.

# IfcSlabType

The element type _IfcSlabType_ defines commonly shared information for occurrences of slabs. The set of shared information may include:

* common properties within shared property sets
* common material information
* common material layer definitions
* common shape representations
<!-- end of short definition -->

It is used to define a slab specification (i.e. the specific product information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type). Slab types may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.

> NOTE The product representations are defined as representation maps (at the level of the supertype _IfcTypeProduct_, which gets assigned by an element occurrence instance through the _IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]_ being an _IfcMappedItem_.

The occurrences of the _IfcSlabType_ within building models are represented by instances of _IfcSlab_.

accessible by the inverse HasAssociations relationship.

The shared material layer set definition is defined by assigning
an _IfcMaterialLayerSet_ (see material use definition above).
The _IfcMaterialLayer_ refers to one or several of
_IfcMaterial_ that is the common for all slab occurrence, if
used. If an _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ is used, all occurrences must have a corresponding _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_.

Walls with openings that have already been modeled within the enclosing geometry may use the relationship _IfcRelConnectsElements_ to associate the wall with embedded elements such as doors and windows.

There are two main representations for all occurrences:

 * _IfcWall_ with _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ is used for all occurrences of walls, that have a non-changing thickness along the wall path and where the thickness parameter can be fully described by a material layer set. These walls are always represented geometrically by an 'Axis' and a 'SweptSolid' shape representation (or by a 'Clipping' geometry based on 'SweptSolid'), if a 3D geometric representation is assigned.

 * _IfcWall_ without _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ is used for all other occurrences of wall, particularly for walls with changing thickness along the wall path (e.g. polygonal walls), or walls with a non-rectangular cross sections (e.g. L-shaped retaining walls), and walls having an extrusion axis that is unequal to the global Z axis of the project (i.e. non-vertical walls), or walls having only 'Brep', or 'SurfaceModel' geometry, or if a more parametric representation is not intended.

> REFERENCE Definition according to ISO 6707-1: vertical construction usually in masonry or in concrete which bounds or subdivides a construction works and fulfils a load bearing or retaining function.

> NOTE An arbitrary planar element to which this semantic information is not applicable (is not predominantly vertical), shall be modeled as _IfcPlate_.

> NOTE The entity _IfcWallStandardCase_ has been deprecated, _IfcWall_ with _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ is used instead. The entity _IfcWallElementedCase_ has been deleted, _IfcWall_ with _IfcRelAggregates_ is used to describe occurrences of wall which are aggregated from subordinate elements, such as wall panels.

> NOTE There is a representation of walls for structural analysis provided by a proper subtype of _IfcStructuralMember_ being part of the _IfcStructuralAnalysisModel_.

## Attributes

### PredefinedType
Predefined generic type for a wall that is specified in an enumeration. There may be a property set given specifically for the predefined types.
> NOTE The _PredefinedType_ shall only be used, if no _IfcWallType_ is assigned, providing its own _IfcWallType.PredefinedType_.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE The attribute has been added at the end of the entity definition.

## Formal Propositions

### CorrectPredefinedType
Either the _PredefinedType_ attribute is unset (e.g. because an _IfcWallType_ is associated), or the inherited attribute _ObjectType_ shall be provided, if the _PredefinedType_ is set to USERDEFINED.

### CorrectTypeAssigned
Either there is no wall type object associated, i.e. the _IsTypedBy_ inverse relationship is not provided, or the associated type object has to be of type _IfcWallType_.

## Concepts

### Axis 2D Geometry

The wall axis is represented by a two-dimensional open curve within a particular shape representation. The 'Axis' shape representation is only used to locate the material layer set along the axis, if the _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ is applied to the _IfcWall_. In this case, the wall axis is used to apply the material layer set usage parameter to the wall geometry.

* Axis
	* _IfcPolyline_ having two Points, or _IfcTrimmedCurve_ with _BasisCurve_ of Type _IfcLine_ for the 'SweptSolid' provided as _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_. The axis curve lies on the x/y plane and is parallel to the x-axis of the object coordinate system.
	* _IfcTrimmedCurve_ with _BasisCurve_ of Type _IfcCircle_ for 'SweptSolid' provided as _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_. The axis curve lies on the x/y plane of the object coordinate system, the tangent at the start is along the positive x-axis.

![straight wall axis](../../../../figures/ifcwallstandard_straigthwall_01-layout1.gif)

Figure 279 — Wall axis straight

Figure 279 illustrates an axis representation for a straight wall. In case of a straight wall, the set of items shall include a single geometric representation item of type _IfcPolyline_ or _IfcTrimmedCurve_ with the _BasisCurve_ being an _IfcLine_. The _IfcPolyline_ or _IfcTrimmedCurve_ shall be parallel (here in a special case co-linear) to the x-axis of the object coordinate system. The direction shall be identical to the direction of the x-axis.

Figure 280 illustrates an axis representation for a curved wall. In case of a curved wall, the set of items shall include a single geometric representation item of type _IfcTrimmedCurve_. The curve shall have a _BasisCurve_ of type _IfcCircle_. The tangent of the _IfcTrimmedCurve_ shall be parallel at start to the x-axis of the object coordinate system. The direction shall be identical to the direction of the x-axis.

#### Axis_IfcBoundedCurve_Curve2D

The wall axis of the wall.

### Body Clipping Geometry

The following additional constraints apply to the 'SweptSolid'
representation, when an _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ is assigned to the _IfcSlab_:

* Solid: _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_ is required
* Profile: _IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef_ and _IfcRectangleProfileDef_ shall be supported.
* Extrusion: All extrusion directions shall be supported.
* Boolean result: The _IfcBooleanClippingResult_ shall be supported, allowing for Boolean differences between the swept solid (here _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_) and one or several _IfcHalfSpaceSolid_ (or subtypes).

Figure 283 illustrates a clipping for a straight wall using an _IfcPolygonalBoundedHalfSpace_ as _SecondOperand_ in
 the _IfcBooleanClippingResult_.

_IfcBooleanClippingResult_.

![curved wall clipping](../../../../figures/ifcwallstandard_curvedwall_03-layout1.gif)

Figure 284 — Wall body clipping curved


### Body SweptSolid Geometry

The following additional constraints apply to the 'SweptSolid' representation:

* Solid: _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_ is required
* Profile: _IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef_ and _IfcRectangleProfileDef_ shall be supported.
* Extrusion: All extrusion directions shall be supported.

Additional constraints apply to the 'SweptSolid' representation, when an _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ is used:

* Extrusion: The profile shall be extruded vertically, i.e., in the direction of the z-axis of the coordinate system of the referred spatial structure element. It might be further constraint to be in the direction of the global z-axis in implementers agreements. The extrusion axis shall be perpendicular to the swept profile, i.e. pointing into the direction of the z-axis of the _Position_ of the _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_.

The profile of a wall is described in the ground view and extruded vertically. The profile (also identical with the foot print of the wall) is defined by the _IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef_ (excluding its subtypes). The profile is given with all wall connections already resolved.

Figure 281 illustrates a body representation for a straight wall. In case of a straight wall, the two sides of the profile shall be parallel to the wall axis, that is, the wall has a single unchanged thickness.

![straight wall body](../../../../figures/ifcwallstandard_straigthwall_02-layout1.gif)

Figure 281 — Wall body extrusion straight

Figure 282 illustrates a body representation for a curved wall. In case of a curved wall, the two sides of the profile shall be parallel (with defined offset) to the wall axis, that is, the wall has a single unchanged thickness.

![curved wall body](../../../../figures/ifcwallstandard_curvedwall_02-layout1.gif)

Figure 282 — Wall body extrusion curved

### Element Decomposition

A wall may decomposed into parts such as framing and panels on each side. For efficiency, each part may reuse geometry using the mapped geometry concept.

![voiding](../../../../figures/ifcwall-partitioning.png)

Figure ELEMENTEDCASE — A wall decomposed into parts.

#### IfcElementAssembly

Frame containing studs, tracks, and possibly insulation

#### IfcBuildingElementPart

Panels on each side such as gypsum (drywall) or cement board (tile backing) with fasteners

#### IfcMember

Studs, posts and similar elements

#### IfcMechanicalFastener

Fasteners that may be used to connect elements together with _IfcRelConnectsWithRealizingElements_

### Element Voiding

As shown in Figure ELEMENTVOID, openings within the composite wall are directly assigned to _IfcWall_ using _IfcRelVoidsElement_ pointing to _IfcOpeningElement_ and apply to all aggregated parts. If individual parts have cutting and other voiding features, then the decomposed parts have a separate voiding relationship _IfcRelVoidsElement_ pointing to _IfcVoidingFeature_.

```

IfcWall [pos="0,0!"];
IfcRelVoidsElement [pos="200,0!"];

}
```

### Material Layer Set Usage

Figure 277 illustrates assignment of _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ and _IfcMaterialLayerSet_ to the _IfcWallType_ and the _IfcWall_ occurrence.

![Material layer set and usage](../../../../figures/ifcwall_materialusage-01.png)

Figure 277 — Wall Standard Object Typing

Figure 278 illustrates material layer usage, where:

* The reference coordinate system is the local coordinate system established by the _ObjectPlacement_ of the _IfcWall_.
* The reference axis is the axis defined by the _IfcShapeRepresentation_ with _RepresentationType_='Axis' as one of the wall's representations.
* The _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage.OffsetFromReferenceLine_ is given as a distance from this axis.
* The _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage.OffsetFromReferenceLine_ is the distance parallel to the reference axis and always within the base
(XY) plane of the reference coordinate system. A positive value of _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage.OffsetFromReferenceLine_ would
then point into the positive y-axis of the reference coordinate system.
* The _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage.DirectionSense_ defines how the _IfcMaterialLayer_'s are assigned to the reference axis. POSITIVE means in direction to the positive y-axis of the reference coordinate system.
* The _Thickness_ of each _IfcMaterialLayer_ is provided starting from the _OffsetFromReferenceLine_ and in the direction given by _DirectionSense_. It is applied without any gap or overlap between two consecutive layers. The _TotalThickness_ of the _IfcMaterialLayerSet_ is the sum of all layer thicknesses.
* The _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage.LayerSetDirection_ is always AXIS2.
* The local placement of the wall uses the the x/y plane for the profile, and the z-axis as the extrusion direction for the wall body.

# IfcWallStandardCase

The _IfcWallStandardCase_ defines a wall with certain constraints for the provision of parameters and with certain constraints for the geometric representation. The _IfcWallStandardCase_ handles all cases of walls, that are extruded vertically:

* along the positive z axis of the wall object coordinate system, and
* along the positive z axis of the global (world) coordinate system

and have a single thickness along the path for each wall layer, i.e.:

* parallel sides for straight walls
* co-centric sides for curved walls.

and have either:

* a straight line axis (straight wall), or
* a circular arc axis (round wall).

and shall not have:

* aggregated components, that is, parts aggregated to a wall by _IfcRelAggregates_
* shape representation for 'Body' not being an extrusion, or clipped extrusion
<!-- end of short definition -->

The following parameter have to be provided:

* Wall height, taken from the depth of extrusion, provided by the geometric representation.
* Wall thickness, taken from the material layer set usage, attached to the wall
* Wall offset from axis, taken from the material layer set usage, attached to the wall

The _IfcWallStandardCase_ requires the provision of the wall axis either a straight line that is parallel to the x-axis of the object coordinate system, or a circular arc where the tangent at start is parallel to the x-axis of the object coordinate system. The direction of the wall axis shall be the positive direction of that x-axis.

The material of the wall is defined by the _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ and is attached by the _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_ objectified relationship. It is accessible by the inverse _HasAssociations_ relationship. The material layer set usage has to be given (enforced by where rule).

An 'Axis' and a 'Body' shape representation has to be provided, and it is invalid to exchange a 'Tessellation', 'SurfaceModel', 'Brep' or 'MappedRepresentation' representation for the 'Body' shape representation of the _IfcWallStandardCase_.

### Material Layer Set Usage


Multi-layer walls can be represented by referring to several
_IfcMaterialLayer_'s within the _IfcMaterialLayerSet_
that is referenced from the
_IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_.


Material information can also be given at the
_IfcWallType_, defining the common attribute data for all
occurrences of the same type. It is then accessible by the
inverse _IsDefinedBy_ relationship pointing to
_IfcSlabType.HasAssociations_ and via
_IfcRelAssociatesMaterial.RelatingMaterial_.

 The _IfcWallType_ should then have a unique
 _IfcMaterialLayerSet_, that is referenced by
the _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ assigned to all
occurrences of this _IfcWallType_.

# IfcWindow

The window is a building element that is predominately used to provide natural light and fresh air. It includes vertical opening but also horizontal opening such as skylights or light domes. It includes constructions with swinging, pivoting, sliding, or revolving panels and fixed panels. A window consists of a lining and one or several panels. A window can:

* be a "free standing" window, contained in an _IfcSpatialElement_ such as an _IfcBuildingStorey_.
* fill an opening, typically in a wall. The window will then have a _FillsVoids_ attribute which uses the _IfcRelFillsElement_ relationship to relate the _IfcWindow_ with the _IfcOpeningElement_;
* be part of an element assembly, typically an _IfcCurtainWall_. The window will then have a _Decomposes_ attribute which uses the the _IfcRelAggregates_ relationship to relate the window with the assembly of elements;
<!-- end of short definition -->

There are two main representations for window occurrences:

 * _IfcWindow_ entities that have a 3D rectangle 'Profile' shape representation defined. This profile can then be used to parametrically generate the geometry of a window. If not provided, the profile of the _IfcOpeningElement_ can be used if the window fills an opening. The parameters are specified on the relating _IfcWindowType_ that references _IfcWindowLiningProperties_ and _IfcWindowPanelProperties_ for each panel in the window;
 * _IfcWindow_ entities that are not parametrically generated and have only 'Brep', or 'SurfaceModel' geometry.

In addition, an _IfcWindow_ may commonly include a 'FootPrint' representation defining the 2D shape of the window and its swing.

 * the window width and height
 * the window opening direction (by the positive y-axis of the _ObjectPlacement_)

The _IfcWindowType_ specifies parameters which are common to all of its occurrences of _IfcWindow_:

 * the partitioning type (single panel, double panel, triple panel, more panels)
 * the operation type (swing, tilt and turn, pivot revolve, fixed casement, etc.)
 * the window panel hinge side (by using two different styles for right and left opening windows)
 * the particular attributes for the lining by the _IfcWindowLiningProperties_
 * the particular attributes for the panels by the _IfcWindowPanelProperties_

> REFERENCE Definition according to ISO 6707-1 Construction for closing a vertical or near vertical opening in a wall or pitched roof that will admit light and may admit fresh air.

## Attributes

### OverallHeight
Overall measure of the height, it reflects the Z Dimension of a bounding box, enclosing the window opening. If omitted, the _OverallHeight_ should be taken from the geometric representation of the _IfcOpeningElement_ in which the window is inserted.

> NOTE The body of the window might be taller then the window opening (for example in cases where the window lining includes a casing). In these cases the _OverallHeight_ shall still be given as the window opening height, and not as the total height of the window lining.

### OverallWidth
Overall measure of the width, it reflects the X Dimension of a bounding box, enclosing the window opening. If omitted, the _OverallWidth_ should be taken from the geometric representation of the _IfcOpeningElement_ in which the window is inserted.

> NOTE The body of the window might be wider then the window opening (for example in cases where the window lining includes a casing). In these cases the _OverallWidth_ shall still be given as the window opening width, and not as the total width of the window lining.

### PredefinedType
Predefined generic type for a window that is specified in an enumeration. There may be a property set given specifically for the predefined types.
> NOTE The _PredefinedType_ shall only be used, if no _IfcWindowType_ is assigned, providing its own _IfcWindowType.PredefinedType_.

## Formal Propositions

### CorrectStyleAssigned
Either there is no window type object associated, i.e. the _IsTypedBy_ inverse relationship is not provided, or the associated type object has to be of type _IfcWindowType_.

### CorrectPredefinedType
Either the _PredefinedType_ attribute is unset (e.g. because an _IfcWindowType_ is associated), or the inherited attribute _ObjectType_ shall be provided, if the _PredefinedType_ is set to USERDEFINED.

### CorrectTypeAssigned
Either there is no door type object associated, i.e. the _IsTypedBy_ inverse relationship is not provided, or the associated type object has to be of type _IfcWindowType_.

## Concepts

### Material Set

#### Lining

Indicates that the material constituent applies to the window lining.

#### Framing

Indicates that the material constituent applies to the windows panels(s); if not provided, the 'Lining' material information applies to panel(s) as well.

#### Glazing

Indicates that the material constituent applies to the glazing part.

### Material Single

If a single _IfcMaterial_ is referenced, it applies to the lining and framing of the window.

### Object Typing

### Product Local Placement

 * The _PlacementRelTo_ relationship of IfcLocalPlacement shall point to the local placement of the same element (if given), in which the _IfcWindow_ is used as a filling (normally an _IfcOpeningElement_), as provided by the _IfcRelFillsElement_ relationship.

 * If the relative placement is not used, the absolute placement is defined within the world coordinate system.

> NOTE The product placement is used to determine the opening direction of the window.

### Profile 3D Geometry

The window profile is represented by a three-dimensional closed curve lying in the xz plane. The profile is used to apply the parameters of a parametric door representation. The following attribute values for the _IfcShapeRepresentation_ holding this geometric representation shall be used:

* _RepresentationIdentifier_: 'Profile'
* _RepresentationType_: 'Curve3D' or 'GeometricCurveSet'. In case of 'GeometricCurveSet' only a single closed curve shall be contained in the set of _IfcShapeRepresentation.Items_.

A 'Profile' representation has to be provided if:

* a parametric representation shall be applied to the
 window AND
  * the window is 'free standing', or
	* the opening into which the window is inserted is not extruded horizontally (i.e. where the opening profile does not match the window profile)

The following additional constraints apply to the 'Profile' representation type:

* Curve: being an _IfcPolyline_ defining a rectangle.
* Position: The curve shall lie in the xz plane of the object placement coordinate (the y coordinate values of the IfcCartesianPoint's shall be 0.).

As shown in Figure 298, the profile defines the outer boundary to which the window
lining parameters relate as:

* _IfcWindowLiningProperties.LiningDepth_ starting at distance defined by _LiningOffset_ going into the positive y direction.
* _IfcWindowLiningProperties.LiningThickness_ offset into the inner side of the rectangle.
* _IfcWindowLiningProperties.LiningOffset_ distance along the positive y direction to where the _LiningDepth_ applies.
* _IfcWindowLiningProperties.FirstTransomOffset_ starting at the bottom edge of the rectangle (along local x axis) into the inner side of the rectangle, distance provided as percentage of overall height. Distance to the centre line of the transom. _SecondTransomOffset_ defined accordingly.
* _IfcWindowLiningProperties.FirstMullionOffset_ starting at the left edge of the rectangle (along local z-axis) into the inner side of the rectangle, distance provided as percentage of overall width. Distance to the centre line of the mullion. _SecondMullionOffset_ defined accordingly.

Figure 298 — Window profile

Figure 1 illustrates the insertion of a parametrically generated window into the _IfcOpeningElement_ by creating an instance of _IfcWindow_ with _PartitioningType = DoublePanelHorizontal_. The parameters _OverallHeight_ and _OverallWidth_ show the extent of the window in the positive Z and X axis of the local placement of the window. The lining and the transom are created by the given parameters.

Figure 2 illustrates the final window (DoublePanelHorizontal) with first panel having _PanelPosition = TOP_, _OperationType = BOTTOMHUNG_ and second panel having _PanelPosition = BOTTOM_ and _OperationType = TILTANDTURNLEFTHAND_.

### Property Sets for Objects

### Quantity Sets

### Spatial Containment

The _IfcWindow_, as any subtype of _IfcBuiltElement_,
may participate alternatively in one of the two different containment relationships:

* the _Spatial Containment_ (defined here), or
* the _Element Composition_.

The _IfcWindow_ may also be connected to the _IfcOpeningElement_ in which it is placed as a filler. In this case, the spatial containment relationship shall be provided, see Figure 297.

![Containment](../../../../figures/ifcwindow_containment-01.png)

Figure 297 — Window spatial containment

> NOTE  The containment shall be defined independently of the filling relationship, that is, even if the
> _IfcWindow_ is a filling of an opening established by _IfcRelFillsElement_, it is also contained in the spatial structure
> by an _IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure_.

### Window Attributes

The parameters that defines the shape of the _IfcWindow_, are given at the _IfcWindowType_ and the property sets, which are included in the _IfcWindowType_. The _IfcWindow_ only defines the local placement which determines the opening direction of the window.

The overall layout and its symbolic presentation of the _IfcWindow_ is determined by its _IfcWindowType.PartitioningType_. The type determines the number and position of window panels. Depending on the type, the appropriate instances of _IfcWindowLiningProperties_ and _IfcWindowPanelProperties_ are attached in the list of _HasPropertySets_.

Each window panel has its own operation type, provided by _IfcWindowPanelProperties.OperationType_. All window panels are assumed to open into the same direction. If relevant for the particular window panel operation, the hinge side (whether a window opens to the left or to the right) is determined by the _IfcWindowPanelProperties_._OperationType_.

See _IfcWindowTypePartitioningEnum_ for the correct usage of panel partitioning and _IfcWindowPanelProperties_ for the opening symbols for different panel operation types.

There are different conventions in different countries on how to show the symbolic presentation of the window panel operation (the "triangles"). Either as seen from the exterior, or from the interior side. Table 3 illustrates window operation symbols from the exterior side (the convention as used predominately in Europe).

| Diagram | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ![fig 1](../../../../figures/ifcwindow-fig01.gif) | The window panel (for side hung windows) opens always into the direction of the positive Y axis of the local placement. The determination of whether the window opens to the left or to the right is done at <em>IfcWindowPanelProperties.OperationType</em>. Here it is a left side opening window given by <em>OperationType</em> = SideHungLeftHand. |
| ![fig 2](../../../../figures/ifcwindow-fig02.gif) | If the window should open to the other side, then the local placement has to be changed. It is still a left hung window, given by <em>IfcWindowPanelProperties.OperationType</em> = SideHungLeftHand. |
| ![fig 3](../../../../figures/ifcwindow-fig03.gif) | If the window panel (for side hung windows) opens to the right, a separate window panel style needs to be used (here <em>IfcWindowPanelProperties.OperationType</em> = SideHungRightHand) and it always opens into the direction of the positive Y axis of the local placement. |
| ![fig 4](../../../../figures/ifcwindow-fig04.gif) | If the window should open to the other side, then the local placement has to be changed. It is still a right hung window, given by <em>IfcWindowPanelProperties.OperationType</em> = SideHungRightHand. |

# IfcWindowType

The element type _IfcWindowType_ defines commonly shared information for occurrences of windows. The set of shared information may include:

* common properties within shared property sets
* common material information
* common partitioning of panels
* common operation types of panels
* common shape representations
<!-- end of short definition -->

A window type defines the particular parameter of the lining and one (or several) panels through the _IfcWindowLiningProperties_ and the _IfcWindowPanelProperties_ as predefined property sets applicable to windows only.

It is used to define a window specification, or window style (the specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that window type). Window types may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.

Occurrences of the _IfcWindowType_ within building models are represented by instances of _IfcWindow_.

> HISTORY New entity in IFC4. The entity _IfcWindowType_ replaces the previous definition _IfcWindowStyle_ (which is deprecated in IFC4).

{ .use-head}
Partitioning type use definition

The _IfcWindowTypePartitioningEnum_ defines the general layout of the window type and its symbolic presentation. Depending on the enumerator, the appropriate instances of _IfcWindowLiningProperties_ and _IfcWindowPanelProperties_ are attached in the list of _HasPropertySets_. The _IfcWindowTypePartitioningEnum_ mainly determines the way of partitioning the window into individual window panels and thereby number and position of window panels.

See geometry use definitions at _IfcWindowTypePartitioningEnum_ for the correct usage of panel partitioning and _IfcWindowPanelProperties_ for the opening symbols for different panel operation types.

{ .use-head}
Material Use Definition

The material of the _IfcWindowType_ is defined by the _IfcMaterialConstituentSet_ or as fall back by _IfcMaterial_ and attached by the _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_._RelatingMaterial_. It is accessible by the inverse _HasAssociations_ relationship.

The following keywords for _IfcMaterialConstituentSet.MaterialConstituents[n].Name_ shall be used:

* 'Lining' - to indicate that the material constituent applies to to the window lining
* 'Framing' - to indicate that the material constituent applies to to the window panels, if not provided, the 'Lining' material information applied to panels as well
* 'Glazing' - to indicate that the material constituent applies to to the glazing part

If the fall back single _IfcMaterial_ is referenced, it applies to the lining and framing of the window.

{ .use-head}
Geometry Use Definitions:

The _IfcWindowType_ may define the common shape of window occurrences. The common shape can be defined by applying the _RepresentationMaps_ attribute to refer to a list of _IfcRepresentationMap_'s, that allow for multiple geometric representations (e.g. with _IfcShapeRepresentation_'s having an _RepresentationIdentifier_ 'Box', 'Profile', 'FootPrint', or 'Body')

>> NOTE The product shape representations are defined as _RepresentationMaps_ (attribute of the supertype _IfcTypeProduct_), which get assigned by an element occurrence instance through the _IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[n]_ being an _IfcMappedItem_. See _IfcTypeProduct_ for further information.

>> NOTE The values of attributes _RepresentationIdentifier_ and _RepresentationType_ of _IfcShapeRepresentation_ are restricted in the same way as those for _IfcWindow_.

## Attributes

### PredefinedType
Identifies the predefined types of a window element from which the type required may be set.

### PartitioningType
Type defining the general layout of the window type in terms of the partitioning of panels.

### ParameterTakesPrecedence
The Boolean value reflects, whether the parameter given in the attached lining and panel properties exactly define the geometry (TRUE), or whether the attached style shape take precedence (FALSE). In the last case the parameter have only informative value. If not provided, no such information can be inferred.

### UserDefinedPartitioningType
Designator for the user defined partitioning type, shall only be provided, if the value of _PartitioningType_ is set to USERDEFINED.

## Formal Propositions

### CorrectPredefinedType
The inherited attribute _ElementType_ shall be provided, if the _PredefinedType_ is set to USERDEFINED.

## Concepts

### Property Sets for Types

Two subtypes of _IfcPreDefinedPropertySet_ are applicable to _IfcWindowType_:

* _IfcWindowLiningProperties_ - a single instance to define the shape parameters of the window lining
* _IfcWindowPanelProperties_ - one or several instances to define the shape parameters of the window panel(s)

IfcSharedBldgElements
=====================

The shared building elements (_IfcSharedBldgElements_) define the subtypes of _IfcBuiltElement_, which is defined in the _IfcProductExtension_. Those subtypes are the major elements, which constitutes the architectural design of the building structure.

The elements (e.g. wall, beam, column, slab, roof, stair, ramp, window, door and covering) are the main components of the raw building (or carcass) which is central for the exchange of project data. For each of those elements a geometric use definition is provided, which introduces the correct application of available shape representation types for the elements.

### PLUMBINGWALL
A pier, or enclosure, or encasement, normally used to enclose plumbing in sanitary rooms. Such walls often do not extend to the ceiling.

### SHEAR
A wall designed to withstand shear loads. Examples of shear wall are diaphragms inside a box girder, typically on a pier, to resist lateral forces and transfer them to the support.

### SOLIDWALL
A massive wall construction for the wall core being the single layer or having multiple layers attached. Such walls are often masonry or concrete walls (both cast in-situ or precast) that are load bearing and fire protecting.

### STANDARD
A standard wall, extruded vertically with a constant thickness along the wall path.
{ .deprecated}
> IFC4 DEPRECATION The value is deprecated, it is expressed by using an _IfcMaterialLayerSet_ with _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ in occurrences.

### POLYGONAL
A polygonal wall, extruded vertically, where the wall thickness varies along the wall path.
> IFC4 DEPRECATION The value is deprecated and shall no longer be used.

### ELEMENTEDWALL
A stud wall framed with studs and faced with sheetings, sidings, wallboard, or plasterwork.

> IFC4.3.2.0 CHANGE This enumeration value is no longer deprecated.

> NOTE An elemented wall can be modelled by means of an aggregation of various components (use _IfcRelAggregates_ to relate to the _IfcWall_), but when this amount of detail is not necessary or available this enumeration value can be used instead.

### RETAININGWALL
A supporting wall used to protect against soil layers behind. Special types of a retaining wall may be e.g. Gabion wall and Grib wall. Examples of retaining walls are wing wall, headwall, stem wall, pierwall and protecting wall.

# IfcDistributionControlElement

The distribution element _IfcDistributionControlElement_ defines occurrence elements of a building automation control system that are used to impart control over elements of a distribution system.
<!-- end of short definition -->

_IfcDistributionControlElement_ defines elements of a building automation control system. These are typically used to control distribution system elements to maintain variables such as temperature, humidity, pressure, flow, power, or lighting levels, through the modulation, staging or sequencing of mechanical or electrical devices. The three general functional categories of control elements are as follows:

* Impart control over flow control elements (_IfcFlowController_) in a distribution system such as dampers, valves, or relays, typically through the use of actuation (_IfcActuator_).
* Sensing elements (_IfcSensor_) that measure changes in the controlled variable such as temperature, humidity, pressure, or flow.
* Controllers (_IfcController_) typically classified according to the control action they seek to perform and generally responsible for making decisions about the elements under control.

Since _IfcDistributionControlElement_ and its subtypes typically relate to many different distribution flow elements (_IfcDistributionFlowElement_), the objectified relationship _IfcRelFlowControlElements_ has been provided to relate control and flow elements as required.

The key distinction between _IfcDistributionFlowElement_ and _IfcDistributionControlElement_ is whether it is internal or external to the flow system, respectively. For example, the distinction between _IfcFlowMeter_ (subtype of _IfcDistributionFlowElement_ measuring a flow quantity) and _IfcFlowInstrument_ (subtype of _IfcDistributionControlElement_ measuring a flow quality), is based on this principal. A physical device that connects within the flow system in which it measures (having inlet/outlet pipes for the measured substance) follows the _IfcDistributionFlowElement_ hierarchy (and therefore _IfcFlowMeter_ which measures the flow internally). Otherwise, if it monitors/controls but does not connect inline within the flow system (it is external or is a component of another device), then it follows the _IfcDistributionControlElement_ hierarchy (and therefore _IfcFlowInstrument_ which may display various attributes through connected sensors).

# IfcDistributionPort

A distribution port is an inlet or outlet of a product through which a particular substance may flow.
<!-- end of short definition -->

Distribution ports are used for passage of solid, liquid, or gas substances, as well as electricity for power or communications. Flow segments (pipes, ducts, cables) may be used to connect ports across products. Distribution ports are defined by system type and flow direction such that for two ports to be connected, they must share the same system type and have opposite flow directions (one side being a _SOURCE_ and the other being a _SINK_). Ports are similar to openings in that they do not have any visible geometry; such geometry is captured at the shape representation of the enclosing element or element type. Ports may have placement that indicates the position and orientation of the connection.

Ports are assigned the distribution systems in order to indicate its role in a particular system, e.g. cold water inlet.

## Attributes

### FlowDirection
Enumeration that identifies if this port is a Sink (inlet), a Source (outlet) or both a SinkAndSource.

### PredefinedType


### SystemType
Enumeration that identifies the system type. If a system type is defined, the port may only be connected to other ports having the same system type.

## Concepts

### Port Connectivity

**IfcDistributionPort** may be connected to other objects as follows using the indicated relationship:

* **IfcDistributionPort** (IfcRelConnectsPorts) : Indicates a connection to another port having the same type and opposite flow direction. For port connections between elements, the RelatingPort is set to a port having _FlowDirection=SOURCE_ and the RelatedPort is set to a port having _FlowDirection=SINK_. For aggregation scenarios, ports on a device may be mapped to aggregated devices within, in which case ports on the outer device indicate a single FlowDirection but have an additional connection internally to a port on an aggregated inner device. Refer to IfcUnitaryEquipment for an example.
* IfcDistributionElement (through IfcRelConnectsPortToElement): For dynamic ports, indicates the containing element.

Figure 302 illustrates distribution port connectivity.

Figure 302 — Distribution port connectivity

### Port Nesting

Distribution ports are indicated on products and product types using the IfcRelNests relationship where RelatingObject refers to the enclosing IfcDistributionElement or IfcDistributionElementType respectively. The order of ports indicates logical ordering such within outlets, junction boxes, or communications equipment.

Ports may be further nested into sub-ports, for indicating specific connections on components or pins.

### Port to Distribution System



### Product Assignment

The **IfcDistributionPort** may be assigned to the following entities using relationships as indicated:

* IfcDistributionSystem (through IfcRelAssignsToGroup): Indicates a system containing interconnected devices.
* IfcPerformanceHistory< (through IfcRelAssignsToControl): Indicates real time or historical information captured for the device.

#### IfcDistributionSystem

Indicates a system that is hosted by the port, as the origination.

#### IfcDistributionCircuit

Indicates a circuit that is switched by the port, as the origination.

### Product Local Placement

The placement of a port indicates the position and orientation of how it may connect to a compatible port on another product. The placement shall be relative to the nesting IfcDistributionElement, IfcDistributionElementType, or enclosing IfcDistributionPort.

The Location is the midpoint of the physical connection, unless otherwise indicated by cardinal point on a material profile.

The Axis points in the direction of the physical connection away from the product if FlowDirection equals SOURCE (or SOURCEANDSINK or NOTDEFINED), or points opposite direction (to the product) if the FlowDirection equals SINK.

> NOTE The rationale for positioning the Axis in the direction of flow is to allow for the same geometry to be used, such as for connectors with polarized cross-section.

The RefDirection points in the direction of the local X axis of the material profile, where the local Y axis points up if looking towards the Axis where the local X axis points right.

Upon connecting elements through ports with rigid connections, each object shall be aligned such that the effective Location, Axis, and RefDirection of each port is aligned to be equal (with exception for circular profiles where the RefDirection need not be equal).

# IfcDistributionSystem

A distribution system is a network designed to receive, store, maintain, distribute, or control the flow of a distribution media. A common example is a heating hot water system that consists of a pump, a tank, and an interconnected piping system for distributing hot water to terminals.
<!-- end of short definition -->

The group _IfcDistributionSystem_ defines the occurrence of a specialized system for use within the context of building services or utilities for built facilities.

Important functionalities for the description of a distribution system are derived from existing IFC entities:

* From _IfcSystem_ it inherits the ability to couple the built system via _IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure_ to one or more _IfcSpatialElement_ subtypes as necessary.

* From _IfcGroup_ it inherits the inverse attribute IsGroupedBy, pointing to the relationship class _IfcRelAssignsToGroup_. This allows the grouping of distribution elements (instances of _IfcDistributionElement_ subtypes).

* From _IfcObjectDefinition_ it inherits the inverse attribute IsDecomposedBy pointing to the relationship class _IfcRelAggregates_. It provides the hierarchy between the separate (partial) distribution systems. For example, an electrical main circuit may be aggregated into branch circuits.

### PredefinedType


## Formal Propositions

### CorrectPredefinedType
Either the _PredefinedType_ attribute is unset, or the inherited attribute _ObjectType_ shall be provided, if the _PredefinedType_ is set to USERDEFINED.

## Concepts

### Aggregation



#### ELECTRICAL_IfcDistributionSystem

Indicates electrical subsystems within the system.

#### ELECTRICAL_IfcDistributionCircuit

Indicates electrical circuits within the system.

### Group Assignment

For the most common case of an IfcDistributionElement subtype containing ports of a particular PredefinedType that all belong to the same distribution system, the IfcDistributionElement is assigned to the IfcDistributionSystem via the IfcRelAssignsToGroup relationship, where IfcDistributionPort's are implied as part of the corresponding system based on their PredefinedType. An IfcDistributionElement may belong to multiple systems, however only one IfcDistributionSystem of a particular PredefinedType.

For rare cases where an IfcDistributionElement subtype contains ports of the same PredefinedType yet different ports belong to different systems, alternatively each IfcDistributionPort may be directly assigned to a single IfcDistributionSystem via the IfcRelAssignsToGroup relationship, where the PredefinedType must match. Such assignment indicates that the IfcDistributionSystem assigned from the IfcDistributionPort overrides any such system of the same PredefinedType assigned from the containing IfcDistributionElement, if any.

Additionally, an IfcDistributionSystem may in turn be assigned to an IfcDistributionPort indicating the host or origination of the system using IfcRelAssignsToProduct.

> EXAMPLE A gas-powered hot water heater may have three ports: GAS, DOMESTICCOLDWATER, and DOMESTICHOTWATER. The heater is a member of two systems (GAS and DOMESTICCOLDWATER), and hosts one system (DOMESTICHOTWATER) at the corresponding port.

## Concepts

### Axis Geometry

Standard representations are defined at the supertype IfcDistributionFlowElement. For parametric flow segments where IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage is defined and an 'Axis' representation is defined, then the 'Body' representation may be generated using the 'SweptSolid' or 'AdvancedSweptSolid' representation types by sweeping the profile(s) along the axis.

### Material Profile Set Usage

The material of the IfcFlowSegment is defined using one of the following entities:


* IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage : for parametric segments, this defines the cross section and alignment to the 'Axis' representation, from which the 'Body' representation may be generated.
* IfcMaterialProfileSet : for non-parametric segments (having fixed length or path), this may define the cross section for analysis purposes, however the 'Body' representation is independently generated.
* IfcMaterialConstituentSet : for elements containing multiple materials where profiles are not applicable, this indicates materials at named parts.
* IfcMaterial : for elements comprised of a single material where profiles are not applicable, this indicates the material.


The material is attached by the RelatingMaterial attribute on the IfcRelAssociatesMaterial relationship. It is accessible by the HasAssociations inverse attribute. Material information can also be given at the IfcFlowSegmentType, defining the common attribute data for all occurrences of the same type. Standard names and material types are defined at subtypes.

# IfcFlowSegmentType

The element type _IfcFlowSegmentType_ defines a list of commonly shared property set definitions of a flow segment and an optional set of product representations. It is used to define a flow segment specification (the specific product information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type).
<!-- end of short definition -->

A flow segment type is used to define the common properties of a flow segment that may be applied to many occurrences of that type. A flow segment is a section of a distribution system, such as a duct, pipe, or conduit, that typically has only two ports. Flow segment types (or the instantiable subtypes) may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.

Occurrences of the _IfcFlowSegmentType_ are represented by instances of _IfcFlowSegment_ or its subtypes.

IfcSharedBldgServiceElements
============================

The _IfcSharedBldgServiceElements_ schema in the interoperability layer defines basic concepts required for interoperability primarily between Building Service domain extensions, notably _IfcHvacDomain_, _IfcPlumbingFireProtectionDomain_, _IfcElectricalDomain_ and _IfcBuildingControlsDomain_. This schema includes concepts such as basic type and occurrence definitions for flow and distribution systems and property sets for common building service scenarios such as fluid-flow properties, electrical properties, and space thermal properties.

Figure 1 illustrates the concepts of type, occurrence and performance. Types are specializations of _IfcDistributionElementType_ while occurrences are specializations of _IfcDistributionElement_. A third theme, defined in the _IfcControlExtension_ schema, relates to the performance characteristics of an occurrence using instances of the _IfcPerformanceHistory_ entity.

A type can have zero or many occurrences. Each occurrence can have many performance history entities associated with it, allowing data that is specific to a certain phase of the lifecycle to be captured and maintained throughout the life of the dataset.

![type, occurrence and performance history concepts](../../../../figures/ifcdistributionport_conceptslide2.gif "Figure 1 &mdash; Building service lifecycle")

The _IfcSharedBldgServiceElements_ schema specializes building services concepts symmetrically for occurrences and types, with the _primary_ functional role of the entity determining its classification into the following generic concepts:

* **Distribution Chamber**: a formed volume used in a distribution system, such as a sump, trench or manhole.
* **Energy Conversion Device**: a building systems device that converts energy from one form into another such as a boiler (combusting gas to heat water), chiller (using a refrigeration cycle to cool a liquid), or a cooling coil (using the phase-change characteristics of a refrigerant to cool air).
* **Flow Controller**: a device that regulates flow within a distribution system, such as a valve in a piping system, modulating damper in an air distribution system, or electrical switch in an electrical distribution system.
* **Flow Fitting**: a device that is used to interconnect flow segments or other fittings within a distribution system, such as a tee in a ducted system that branches flow into two directions, or a junction box in an electrical distribution system.
* **Flow Moving Device**: a device that is used to produce a pressure differential in a distribution system, such as a pump, fan, or compressor.
* **Flow Segment**: a section of a distribution system, such as a duct, pipe, or conduit.
* **Flow Storage Device**: a device used for the temporary storage of a substance (solid, liquid, or gas) such as a tank, or the voltage potential induced by the induced electron flow (a battery).
* **Flow Terminal**: acts as a terminus or beginning element in a distribution system such as a ceiling register in a ducted air distribution system, a sink in a waste-water system, or a light fixture in an electrical lighting system.
* **Flow Treatment Device**: a device used to change the physical properties of the medium, such as an air, oil or water filter (used to remove particulates from the fluid), or a duct silencer (used to attenuate noise).

Refer to the domain schemas where types and occurrences are further elaborated using _PredefinedType_ enumerations for examples of the range of supported concepts within these broad classifications. If a new type is needed within this classification, extend using the ElementType attribute. However, if a completely new concept is required that does not fit within this classification, use instances of the generic _IfcDistributionElementType_ and _IfcDistributionElement_ entities for the type/occurrence objects as needed.

Occurrences in a distribution system are typically coupled together using instances of _IfcDistributionPort_. This is also where concepts such as mass-flow properties are applied based on performance characteristics. Refer to the _IfcDistributionPort_ documentation within this schema for further elaboration on coupling together components in a distribution system and tracking the flow characteristics across the port boundaries.

# IfcElementComponent

An element component is a representation for minor items included in, added to or connecting to or between elements, which usually are not of interest from the overall building structure viewpoint. However, these small parts may have vital and load carrying functions within the construction. These items do not provide any actual space boundaries. Typical examples of _IfcElementComponent_s include different kinds of fasteners and various accessories.
<!-- end of short definition -->

One or several instances of subtypes of _IfcElementComponent_ should always be accompanied by a defining instance of a respective subtype of _IfcElementComponentType_. The type object holds shape and material information.

> HISTORY New entity in IFC2x2

It is often desirable to model a number of same-shaped element components by means of a single occurrence object, e.g. several bolts within a connection or a row of reinforcement elements. In this IFC release, this is possible by means of multiple mapped representation as documented below.

To express the multiplicity of element components also on a higher semantic level, a _Qto_ElementComponentPatternQuantities_ should be provided via _IfcRelDefinesByProperties_ and contain the number of pieces which are placed by a single _IfcElementComponent_ instance.

{ .use-head}
**Symbolic Representation**

A symbolic representation is defined for a row of components or several rows of components within a single instance of _IfcElementComponent_. Such rows or arrays may contain possibly large numbers of individual pieces. The product definition shape consists of an _IfcShapeRepresentation_ with the attribute values

* _RepresentationIdentifier_ : 'Row'
* _RepresentationType_ : 'GeometricCurveSet'

and one or several curves as geometric items. The curves represent where reference points of the pieces are located. For example, such reference points may be at the heads of mechanical fasteners or at the starting point of the extrusion axis of reinforcement bars. In case of straight components (bolts, nails, staples, straight reinforcement bars, or similar), the local placement of the _IfcElementComponent_ shall be located and oriented such that the local z axis is parallel with the axes of the components. A _Qto_ElementComponentPatternQuantities_ should denote the count of pieces in the row or array and their spacing.

## Concepts

### Mapped Geometry

The mapped item, IfcMappedItem, should be used if appropriate as it allows for reusing the geometry definition of a type at all occurrences of the same type.

A single instance of a subtype of IfcElementComponent can stand for several
actual element components at once. In this case, the IfcShapeRepresentation
contains as many mapped items as there are element components combined within this
 occurrence object.

![](../../../../figures/ifcelementcomponent_multiple.png)

Figure 304 — Element component mapped representation

> EXAMPLE  Figure 304 illustrates multiple components modeled as a single occurrence object (here: IfcFastener)

Representation identifier and type are the same as in single mapped representation.
The number of mapped items in the representation corresponds with the count of
element components in the IfcElementQuantity.

Classification Use Definition

Mechanical fasteners, especially bolts, are often standardized. To refer to a formal fastener designation according to a standard (a product norm), _IfcRelAssociatesClassification_ together with _IfcClassificationReference_ should be used.

* _IfcClassificationReference.Identification_ contains a machine-readable form of the formal fastener designation from the norm. Example: 'M16X80-10.9-HV' for a high-strength structural bolting assembly for preloading with hexagon bolt and nut. (On the other hand, _IfcMechanicalFastenerType.Name_ contains a displayable name which may not necessarily be the same as the formal designation.)
* _IfcClassificationReference.Name_ carries the short name of the fastener norm. Example: 'EN 14399-4' as the respective European standard for high-strength hexagon bolts.
* Optionally, the norm can be further described by _IfcClassificationReference.ReferencedSource_, including information like publisher and date of issue of the norm.

Furthermore, _IfcRelAssociatesLibrary_ together with _IfcLibraryReference_ may be used to refer to a library which contains fastener definitions.

# IfcAsset

An asset is a uniquely identifiable grouping of elements acting as a single entity that has a financial value or that can be operated on as a single unit.
<!-- end of short definition -->

An asset is generally the level of granularity at which maintenance operations are undertaken. An asset is a group that can contain one or more elements. Whilst the financial value of a component or element can be defined, financial value is also defined for accounting purposes at the level of the asset.

There are a number of actors that can be associated with an asset, each actor having a role. Actors within the scope of the project are indicated using the IfcRelAssignsToActor relationship in which case roles should be defined through the IfcActorRole class; otherwise principal actors are identified as attributes of the class. In the existence of both, direct attributes take precedence.

There are a number of costs that can be associated with an asset, each cost having a role. These are specified through the _OriginalValue_, _CurrentValue_, _TotalReplacementCost_ and _DepreciatedValue_ attributes.

> HISTORY New entity in IFC2x.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE All attributes made optional and date values changed to use _IfcDate_.

## Attributes

### Identification
A unique identification assigned to an asset that enables its differentiation from other assets.
> NOTE The asset identifier is unique within the asset register. It differs from the globally unique id assigned to the instance of an entity populating a database.

### OriginalValue
The cost value of the asset at the time of purchase.

### CurrentValue
The current cost value of the asset.

### TotalReplacementCost
The total cost of replacement of the asset.

### Owner
The name of the person or organization that 'owns' the asset.

### User
The name of the person or organization that 'uses' the asset.

### ResponsiblePerson
The person designated to be responsible for the asset.
> NOTE In some regulations (for example, UK Health and Safety at Work Act, Electricity at Work Regulations), management of assets must have a person identified as being responsible and to whom regulatory, insurance and other organizations communicate. In places where there is not a legal requirement, the responsible person would be the asset manager but would not have a legal status.

### IncorporationDate
The date on which an asset was incorporated into the works, installed, constructed, erected or completed.
> NOTE This is the date on which an asset is considered to start depreciating.

{ .history}
> IFC4 CHANGE Type changed from IfcDateTimeSelect.

### DepreciatedValue
The current value of an asset within the accounting rules and procedures of an organization.

## Concepts

### Classification Association

The operating function of an asset within an organization may be particularly valuable in situations where one organization provides and maintains core services and another organization adds and maintains terminal services. Operating function can be designated through the use of one or more classification references.

#### IfcSpatialStructureElement

Indicates the property to be occupied. Particular details of the agreement relating to the occupancy of a property are dealt within the Pset_PropertyAgreement that is defined for the instance of IfcSpatialStructureElement. This means that an occupant may be related to a site, building, building storey or space through the _IfcSpatialStructureElement.ElementComposition_ attribute. For instance, if the property concerned is several office spaces on a building storey, it might be appropriate to reference _IfcBuildingStorey.ElementComposition=PARTIAL_. Occupants of a property may be considered to be the parties to an agreement. The roles that the occupant may play in respect to an agreement are defined in the IfcOccupantTypeEnum enumeration. If the role is not specified by the predefined contents of this enumeration, the value USERDEFINED may be set and the ObjectType attribute asserted.

IfcSharedFacilitiesElements
===========================

The _IfcSharedFacilitiesElements_ schema defines basic concepts in the facilities management (FM) domain. This schema, along with _IfcProcessExtension_ and _IfcSharedMgmtElements_, provide a set of models that can be used by applications needing to share information concerning facilities management related issues.

The _IfcSharedFacilitiesElements_ schema supports ideas including:

* Furniture.
* Grouping of elements of system furniture into individual furniture items.
* Asset identification.
* Inventory of objects (including asset, furniture and space objects within separate inventories).

### 6.4.1.1 Furniture and System Furniture
In the _IfcProductExtension_ schema, the _IfcElement_ entity is decomposed into a number of subtypes. One of these is the _IfcFurnishingElement_ entity from the _IfcFurniture_ and _IfcSystemFurnitureElement_ entities are derived.

Figure 1 illustrates a furniture object (instance of the _IfcFurniture_ entity, which is considered to be a discrete item of furniture in its own right (for example, a table or chair).

![Furniture](../../../../figures/ifcsharedfacilitieselements-fig01.gif)

Figure 1 - Furniture

Figure 2 illustrates a system furniture element object (instance of the _IfcSystemFurnitureElement_ entity), which is an identifiable item (such as a modesty panel, side, or desktop) that participates in the assembly of a discrete item of furniture.

![SystemFurnitureElements](../../../../figures/ifcsharedfacilitieselements-fig02.gif)

Figure 2 &mdash; System furniture element

Each _IfcFurniture_ object and each _IfcSystemFurnitureElement_ object is of a particular type. It may be a chair, desk, table etc for discrete furniture or modesty panel, side panel, desktop etc. for system furniture. Specification of the type is left to the user of the application providing the information. For applications however, there are a number of predefined property sets for types of furniture that can be assigned to furniture objects. Other property sets may be defined as necessary.

### 6.4.1.2 Asset Identification
An _IfcAsset_ allows for the grouping of objects to form a unit that has an identifiable financial value and/or upon which specific facilities management operations take place, as shown in Figure 3.

Each asset carries a unique identifier, cost, ownership,location and other information that is required.

![Assets](../../../../figures/ifcsharedfacilitieselements-fig03.gif)

Figure 3 &mdash; Asset identification

### 6.4.1.3 Inventory
An _IfcInventory_ provides a list of objects of a particular type, the type of objects that are contained being identified by the _IfcInventoryTypeEnum_.

Each inventory has one or more responsible persons and an organizational jurisdiction (which is valuable in facilities management situations where more than one functional group or organization is concerned).

# IfcSignal

A signal is an active device that conveys information or instructions to users, by means of an audio, visual signal or a combination of both.
<!-- end of short definition -->

The primary distinction from an _IfcSign_ is that a signal is active and therefore a subtype of _IfcFlowTerminal_ usually requiring power and data connections for its operation.
An instance of _IfcSignal_ represents a singular signalling device in a larger assembled unit or connected system, such as an individual frame within a railway signal, a single light unit in a traffic light system or an audio signal or light mounted on a navigational buoy.
Signals can be physically aggregated together into an assembly which can include multiple signal instances (and also sign instances) and the associated supporting structural elements such as a simple pole or a rigid frame gantry (see Signal Assembly for examples).
Signals can be logically (functionally) grouped together into a signalling system (a type of distribution system) to represent a connected group of signals for example a group of traffic lights controlling an road intersection.

----------------------------------

# IfcCostItem

An _IfcCostItem_ describes a cost or financial value together with descriptive information that describes its context in a form that enables it to be used within a cost schedule. An _IfcCostItem_ can be used to represent the cost of goods and services, the execution of works by a process, lifecycle cost and more.
<!-- end of short definition -->

Each instance of _IfcCostItem_ may have a name and a description. Depending on the use for which the cost is intended, these values should be asserted on the basis of agreement. For instance, the _Name_ attribute could be used to provide a common value that enables distinct instances to be brought together in a nesting arrangement (see below) while the Description attribute may be used to provide text used for item description in a costing schedule.

An _IfcCostItem_ can link one or many _IfcCostValue_'s representing a unit cost, total cost, or a unit cost with one or many quantities used to generate the total cost. The quantities can be given as individual quantities, or those quantities are provided as element quantities by one or many building elements. The _IfcCostValue.Category_ attribute indicates the category of cost, which may be used to present the value in a particular column. For nested cost items (having _IfcRelNests_ relationship), _IfcCostValue.Category_ is significant such that _IfcCostValue.AppliedValue_ is calculated as the sum of all nested costs having the same _IfcCostValue.Category_ or if set to an asterisk ('\*'), then the sum of all nested costs of all cost types. An _IfcCostValue_ may represent an original value or a value derived from formulas. For example, taxes may be calculated as a percentage of a subtotal.

> HISTORY New entity in IFC2.0.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE Attribute _PredefinedType_, _CostValues_, and _CostQuantities_ added.

## Attributes

### PredefinedType
Predefined generic type for a cost item that is specified in an enumeration. There may be a property set given specifically for the predefined types.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE The attribute has been added.

### CostValues
Component costs for which the total cost for the cost item is calculated, and then multiplied by the total _CostQuantities_ if provided.

If _CostQuantities_ is provided then values indicate unit costs, otherwise values indicate total costs.

For calculation purposes, the cost values may be directly added unless they have qualifications. Cost values with qualifications (e.g. _IfcCostValue.ApplicableDate_, _IfcCostValue.FixedUntilDate_) should be excluded from such calculation if they do not apply.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE The attribute has been added.

### CostQuantities
Component quantities of the same type for which the total quantity for the cost item is calculated as the sum.
{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE The attribute has been added.

## Concepts

### Classification Association

Instances of IfcCostItem are used for cost estimates, budgets, and other forms, where a variety of identification codes are used extensively to identify the meaning of the cost. Examples include project phase codes, CSI codes, takeoff sequence numbers, and cost accounts. The model allows for all classes that are ultimately subtypes of IfcObject to inherit the ability to have one or more instances of IfcClassificationReference to be assigned. Where identification codes are required, the generic IfcRelAssociatesClassification facility should be used.

### Control Assignment

An IfcCostItem can be calculated based on quantities from objects through its relationship to IfcRelAssignsToControl.

For quantity-based costing, IfcElement, IfcTask, or IfcResource occurrence subtypes may be used. Multiple elements may be assigned of the same or different types, using IfcPhysicalQuantity entities defined at each object. Each IfcPhysicalQuantity type must be identical (for example, all values are IfcQuantityArea) such that they can be added together.

For rate-based costing (specifically for _IfcCostScheduleTypeEnum.SCHEDULEOFRATES_), a single IfcTypeProduct, IfcTypeProcess, or IfcTypeResource subtype may be used to reflect rates for occurrences of such types. This enables the possibility to generate a quantity-based cost schedule for occurrences based on types with rate-based cost schedules.

IfcRelAssignsToControl is also used in the opposite direction to link the root IfcCostItem to an IfcCostSchedule where RelatingControl is the IfcCostSchedule.

Figure 311 illustrates cost item assignment derived from building elements. The IfcRelAssignsToControl relationship indicates building elements for which quantities are derived. Not shown, costs may also be derived from building elements by traversing assignment relationships from the assigned IfcProduct to IfcProcess to IfcResource, where all costs ultimately originate at resources. It is also possible for cost items to have assignments from processes or resources directly.


![cost item](../../../../figures/ifccostitem-assignment.png)
Figure 311 — Cost assignment

#### IfcProduct

For quantity-based costs based on product occurrences, spatial structures, or other physical artifacts.

#### IfcProcess

For quantity-based costs based on tasks, procedures, or events.

#### IfcResource

For quantity-based costs based on resource allocations.

#### IfcTypeProduct

For cost rates based on product models.

#### IfcTypeProcess

For cost rates based on process models of historical or projected duration.

#### IfcTypeResource

For cost rates based on resource models of historical or projected productivity.

### Object Nesting

An IfcCostItem can nest other instances of IfcCostItem through its relationships to IfcRelNests. This can be used to enable the development of complex groups of costs as may be found in cost schedules through to pages, sections and complete cost schedules.

There is always a summary cost item as the root item of the tree representing the cost item nesting. Subsequent instances of IfcCostItem are assigned to the summary cost item using IfcRelNests. The summary cost item itself is assigned to IfcCostSchedule through the IfcRelAssignsToControl relationship.

## Concepts

### Aggregation



#### ACCESS_IfcWorkCalendar

A work calendar may indicate the time period of the permit and allowed times when work may be performed. Such work calendar may have assigned resources indicating equipment or labor permitted at various times.

#### WORK_IfcWorkSchedule

A work schedule may indicate tasks and scheduled times where the work schedule type may designate whether tasks and/or times are planned or actual. Such work schedule may have assigned tasks indicating detail, where tasks may be assigned to products and may have assigned resources.

### Approval Association

Approvals may be associated to indicate the status of acceptance or rejection using the IfcRelAssociatesApproval relationship where RelatingApproval refers to an IfcApproval and RelatedObjects contains the IfcPermit. Approvals may be split into sub-approvals using IfcApprovalRelationship to track approval status separately for each party where RelatingApproval refers to the higher-level approval and RelatedApprovals contains one or more lower-level approvals. The hierarchy of approvals implies sequencing such that a higher-level approval is not executed until all of its lower-level approvals have been accepted.

### Control Assignment

Figure 312 illustrates assignment relationships as indicated:


* IfcActor (IfcRelAssignsToActor): Organization issuing the permit such as a local government agency or security organization.


 The IfcPermit may have assignments of its own using the IfcRelAssignsToControl relationship where RelatingControl refers to the IfcPermit and RelatedObjects contains one or more objects of the following types:

* IfcActor: Organization(s) bound to the permit, typically a single contractor.

### Object Nesting



#### IfcPermit

A permit may be nested to indicate permit amendments, in order of issue.

# IfcProjectOrder

A project order is a directive to purchase products and/or perform work, such as for construction or facilities management.
<!-- end of short definition -->

Project orders are typically formal contracts between two organizations, where cost and time information may be rigid or flexible according to contained schedule types and constraints.

## Attributes

### PredefinedType
Predefined generic type for a project order that is specified in an enumeration. There may be a property set given specifically for the predefined types.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE The attribute has been made optional.

### Status
The current status of a project order.Examples of status values that might be used for a project order status include:
* PLANNED
* REQUESTED
* APPROVED
* ISSUED
* STARTED
* DELAYED
* DONE

### LongDescription
A detailed description of the project order describing the work to be completed.

## Concepts

### Aggregation

As shown in Figure 160, an IfcProjectOrder may be aggregated into components.


![Composition Use Definition](../../../../figures/ifcprojectorder-composition.png)
Figure 313 — Project order composition

#### WORKORDER_IfcCostSchedule

A cost schedule may indicate costs and quantities where the cost schedule type may designate whether rates and/or quantities are estimated or final. Such cost schedule may have assigned cost items indicating detail, where each cost item may have assigned products, processes, or resources.

### Approval Association

Approvals may be associated to indicate the status of acceptance or rejection using the IfcRelAssociatesApproval relationship where RelatingApproval refers to an IfcApproval and RelatedObjects contains the IfcProjectOrder. Approvals may be split into sub-approvals using IfcApprovalRelationship to track approval status separately for each party where RelatingApproval refers to the higher-level approval and RelatedApprovals contains one or more lower-level approvals. The hierarchy of approvals implies sequencing such that a higher-level approval is not executed until all of its lower-level approvals have been accepted.


### Control Assignment

Figure 314 illustrates IfcProjectOrder assignment relationships as indicated:


* *IfcActor* (*IfcRelAssignsToActor*): Organization issuing the order such as an owner or contractor.


 The IfcProjectOrder may have assignments of its own using the *IfcRelAssignsToControl* relationship where RelatingControl refers to the IfcProjectOrder and RelatedObjects contains one or more objects of the following types:

* *IfcActor*: Organization(s) contracted to fulfill the order, typically a single contractor, subcontractor, or supplier.

### Object Nesting



#### IfcProjectOrder

May contain subordinate orders, particularly change orders indicating contract amendment in order of issue.

IfcSharedMgmtElements
=====================

The **IfcSharedMgmtElements** schema defines basic concepts that are common to management throughout the various stages of the building lifecycle. The primary classes in the schema are all subtypes of _IfcControl_ and act to manage or regulate the conduct of the project in some way. This schema, along with _IfcProcessExtension_ and _IfcConstructionMgmtDomain_, provide a set of models that can be used by applications needing to share information concerning construction and facilities management related issues.

The objective of the **IfcSharedMgmtElements** schema is to capture information that supports the control of project scope, cost, and time. The aim is to provide support for exchange and sharing of minimal information concerning the subjects in scope; the extent of the model will not support the more detailed ideas found in more specialized management applications.

The following are within the scope of this part of the specifications:

* Cost schedules supporting hierarchical rows and columns of costs and quantities.
* Orders including purchase orders, change orders, and work orders.
* Permits for access and carrying out work.
* Requests to be fulfilled.

The following are outside of the scope of this part of the specifications:

* Transaction details that may be supported by or support electronic commerce.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE  The former schema _IfcFacilitiesMgmtDomain_ has been merged into this schema to include the entities _IfcPermit_ and _IfcActionRequest_, as each entity now also supports use in construction as well as facilities management.
